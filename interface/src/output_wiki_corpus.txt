YMCA in South Australia
South Australia (SA)  has a unique position in Australia's history as, unlike the other states which were founded as colonies, South Australia began as a self governing province Many were attracted to this and Adelaide and SA developed as an independent and free thinking state.
The compound of philosophical radicalism, evangelical religion and self reliant ability typical of its founders had given an equalitarian flavour to South Australian thinking from the beginning.
It was into this social setting that in February 1850 a meeting was called primarily for the formation of an Association (apparently meaning a Y.M.C.A.)
for apprentices and others, after their day's work, to enjoy books, lectures, discussions, readings, friendly relief and recreation for a leisure hour.
In September 1850 records show that this became “The Young Men's Christian Association of South Australia" as evidenced by a member's letter in London Y.M.C.A.
Report 1851.
There was no census in 1850 but the 1851 census put the total population of South Australia at 63,700 with males numbering 35,302.
The discovery of Gold in Ballarat caused a large migration from South Australia and by 1852 some 8000 had left for the Goldfields.
As a consequence the various YMCA groups that had become established failed and by 1870 none remained.
"The next available authentic record of an Association in South Australia does not appear until some members of London Y.M.C.A.
coming to Adelaide, joined with ex members of the defunct original Adelaide Branch, and also members of the Brompton Association.
A meeting of promoters was also held at Presbyterian Church.
They became associated in the Exchange Room of the Adelaide Town Hall on November 28th, 1878 at a public meeting for the promotion of a revival of the Y.M.C.A.
in Adelaide.
Sir John Colton (a member of the Adelaide Association in 1853 and a founder of Prince Alfred College) had been asked to preside, but was absent through illness and the chair was occupied by Mr. Richard Searle ( a managing partner of D & W Murray and Co ) who became the first President of the Association.
A committee was formed to draft a constitution, later drawn up and signed by 585 Adelaide young men."
Since that time the YMCA has operated continuously, been part of the fabric of the state and  served the community of South Australia
Leading the YMCA was regarded as a calling and attracted men of compassion and social conscience.
Not known as chief executive officers until the 1990s, they were known as General Secretaries.
With the YMCA of Adelaide one of the very early organisations for social good it attracted some of the state's leading influential figures to its board and men of high calibre as General Secretary.
The history of the organisation in South Australia is very much tied to the leadership by both General Secretaries (CEOs) and the presidents along with the boards who backed them.
1879 - H.H.
Birt.
appointed by the board on a part-time basis.
Birt oversaw activities in the temporary premises, Salisbury Chambers in king William Street and to manage the alteration of the newly leased premises in Gawler Place which opened 27 August 1879.
1880 -1886 Alex A Walker.
Walker was secretary of the Flinders Street Presbyterian Men's Society which merged into the YMCA with him continuing as General Secretary.
In 1886 the annual report of the YMCA indicated a lack of funds and Walker confessed to having appropriated £1288/16/7.
In court and before Chief Justice Sir Samuel Way, Walker revealed the money had gone on assisting impecunious young men.
Walker was regarded as a very hard working Secretary who said he did not have a night off in any month and the board believed he did not have fraudulent intent but compassion rather than criminality.
He was sent to jail for 4 years hard labour.
1886 - 1900 John James Virgo.
The 'new' YMCA building in Gawler Place was opened in 1884 and in 1886 the Glenelg born Virgo was appointed General Secretary following the conviction of the previous General Secretary for embezzling funds.
In 1888 the YMCA began Our Boys Institute for work among boys 13 to 18 years of age.
For young men, activities included Bible classes, sporting teams, lectures, debating and choral societies, a gymnasium, camps and an employment and immigration department.
Virgo was prominent in Adelaide's religious life and conducted evangelistic services on Sunday evenings at the Theatre Royal in Hindley Street.1900 Virgo became secretary of the Australasian Union of Y.M.C.A.s and 1903 was appointed secretary of the Y.M.C.A., Sydney then General Secretary of the London Central Y.M.C.A.
in 1911.
Virgo wrote his memoirs in 1939.
He died in 1956.
1905 - 1916 H.A Wheeler.
Wheeler was a capable administrator who adapted the programmes and emphasis to the times.
Much of the evangelical work was dropped to focus on the work with young men.
In 1908 Wheeler left for two years to work with the YMCA in America.
This forged a link with North American YMCA's and more modern methods of physical development and a rapid development of membership.
An employment department was formed in 1912 fulfilling an important social welfare role especially for young male migrants.
At the outbreak of WW1 Wheeler took the initiative in promoting a nation-wide War Services Y.M.C.A.
organisation and later was placed in charge of all Australian War Services in the European Zone.
WW1 saw the Adelaide YMCA support YMCA staff overseas as evidenced by a letter to Wheeler from Menza camp Egypt by Col S Price Weir OC 10th battalion.
by1916 The army Department was the largest work done by the Adelaide YMCA with operations at Mitcham, Cheltenham, Balaklava, Murray Bridge, Torrens Island, Gawler.
The YMCA provided comfort, counselling and recreation to the troops.
YMCA war services were funded by public donation and during this time in South Australia ₤199,185 was raised.
1908 -1910 - H.S.
Stafford acting General Secretary.
Stafford, an American from Dayton Ohio was working at the Bendigo YMCA and took the acting role while Wheeler spent 2 years working for the YMCA in the United States His work transformed the organisation as recognised in a speech by the then President Henry J Holden who said of him.
".. it was not an association of Christian young men but a Christian association for all young men"
1916 -1920 The title of General Secretary was discontinued this period as post war the organisation needed to adjust having been dominated by the military units.
Two officers controlled the organisation.
M.U.
Maddern was secretary to the Army Department and R Taylor became Secretary of the General Department.
This gave lack of continuity at the top at a time when the planning for transition to peace time was so important.
1920 Jack Tolston Massey.
Jack Massey began his YMCA career as a field secretary attached to the Australian Imperial Forces A Christian (Anglican) and a pacifist he served in England France and Belgium assisting soldiers awaiting repatriation.
He was appointed as General Secretary of the Adelaide YMCA in 1920 and went on to build and expand the organisation as well as develop programmes and advocate for young people with accomplishments including establishing a court for juvenile offenders and guiding amateur football in SA.
He also provided support for British Boys brought out to help in agriculture.
He attended the 100 years of Adelaide YMCA in 1978 not long before his death in 1981 and was acclaimed as one of the great men of the organisation and the community for his life of service.
1939 - 1960 Alf Gibbs .
During WW1 Alf Gibbs served as YMCA War Services Department Chief Commissioner overseeing YMCA staff in almost all military camps and some 62 representative overseas to assist the troops.
Gibbs was appointed General Secretary Adelaide YMCA after some negotiations with the Adelaide YMCA Board while Alf was in India.
He oversaw the expansion of the YMCA and the sale of the Gawler Place building.
In 1956 he negotiated the purchase of the Presbyterian Church in Flinders Street which was demolished the following year and a new modern YMCA youth complex and residential facility was constructed.
Gibbs led the fundraising that enabled the construction of YMCA youth facilities at Walkerville, Kilburn, Elizabeth and Glenelg.

1960s
Graeme Irvine.
Irvine was an evangelical Christian and developed in the Adelaide YMCA a group of similar thinking leaders.
Ultimately this became exclusive and counterproductive.
He went on to build up World Vision Australia and then to New York where he grew the organisation into a large multinational NGO.
Irvine was in 1978 among the signers of the "Declaration of Internationalization", which declared a set of objectives for World Vision in its operations throughout the world.
In 1988, Irvine became the first non-American president of World Vision International.
Jim Daly.

Other initiatives included Dollar Day a door knocking fundraiser and the City Port Fun Run which attracted thousands of runners.
1980s
Trevor Cleland.
Was promoted from accountant to CEO with limited success.
This created a crisis which inspired the recruitment to the board of some former Y members high in the corporate world who could use there expertise to review the organisation.
Clive Armour (CEO of ETSA) Colin Williamson (CEO of Strategic Resources Consulting).
A restructure of the organisation and shaking off the old Methodist mentality about paying people for their 'calling'.
The board upped the salary offering from $19,000 to $52,000 and went to market for a new CEO.
Rob Dowling 1990?
- 2003.
Dowling came from Carclew Performing Arts and became our first leaders called a CEO as the others were titled General Secretaries.
Dowling was a transformational leader and kept all the Y programmes running at a high level and established a Registered Training Organisation running certificate course out of the Flinders Street headquarters.
With the Flinders Street property becoming outdated and run down Dowling sought to redevelop site.. A 12-story, strata titled building with the Y having some floors and selling off others.
Plans were drawn by Woodhead Australia and funding partners sought.
Brilliant idea but the board was not able to pull it off.
The Flinders' Street property was then sold as cost of fire compliance and the age of the building proved uneconomical to refurbish.
Closing the residential wing affected the organisations cash flow.
Dowling sought to purchase another building, an old bank, but not supported by the Board.
Dowling left to undertake teaching and research at Flinders University before retirement to the Adelaide hills.
Dave Bedson: Held the position for a short time.
2000s
Mike Kelly.
Driven by the board policy Kelly spent his time trying to win contracts for student accommodation which was an emerging area of service due to the growing numbers of overseas students in Adelaide.
This chewed up significant funds which ultimately delivered no results and the money from the sale of Flinders Street property began to diminish.
Changing time saw the diminishing of the camping programme and Explorers and Adventurers.
Peter Schwartz.
A former footballer Schwartz did some very good work, won the Aquadome contract and set up Community Strengthening unit, after school care and negotiated access to HACC grant funding to expand YMCA social services.

Lucas (Charley Palmer Rothwell) and Chloé (Roxane Mesquida) are a former dysfunctional couple who, after having spent a year apart, meet again because Chloé decides to invite him to play a game called Paranoia, in which they offer a million euros to the two players who finish the game.
By gathering the clues to be accepted in the game they arrive at a party, where they find a way to reach an abandoned hospital where the game will take place.
Upon arrival a mysterious voice tells all the players the rules of the game and how to play, but what the mysterious voice does not tell the players is that the main rules of the game are: Number 1: Nothing is real, and Number 2 : One of you will die.
When starting the game Lucas begins to notice that something was not normal and that in the game they were only trying to kill all the players, but Chloé refuses to believe that anyone wants to kill them all.
Minutes after having passed the first test of the game, in the second test of the game they run into the corpse of one of the players, so both begin to worry and get scared.
Frightened by what happened, Chloé and Lucas just try to finish the game to save their lives, and later in a room they find another corpse of another player and some papers where there was information about Naomi (Marie Zabukovec), who was actually admitted to the hospital abandoned years ago, and she was a totally dangerous patient.
So Chloé deduces that she is the murderer.
After having passed some tests of the game, they reach the final test, which makes them go to the abandoned hospital church, that's where Chloé discovers that Lucas is really the murderer and that he is a psychopath who suffers from memory loss.
From what Chloé makes him believe that they are about to reach the end of the game, when she finds a ladder to go up to the second floor of the church, she decides pushing Lucas from the stairs and she flees the place, but he manages to find her and kill her.
While he is unaware of what he was doing, he thinks he has found the murderer who killed all the players in the game, but the murderer is really himself, and that is where it is discovered that he murdered his mother and that he organized everything the game.

Kazakh playing cards
Kazakh playing cards ("Qazaq Deck") are a deck of 54 cards used in Kazakhstan and other countries for playing Kazakh national playing card games.
The deck allows people, especially foreigners, to become acquainted with the rich world of cultural traditions and customs of the Kazakhs.
Kazakh playing cards differ from the classic French deck in that it has unique non-standard suits, i.e.
Horse, Apple, Eagle, and Tulip.
In other words, there is no division into classes such as: clubs representing the peasantry; diamonds, the merchant class; hearts, the clergy; spades, the warrior class.
Alternatively, the Kazakh suits are divided into the so-called Yurts ("jurttar") that represent the different ways relatives are connected to a person.
There are four traditional Yurts: Óz Yurt symbolizing relatives on father’s side; Naǵashy Yurt, relatives on mother’s side; Qaıyn Yurt, relatives on spouse’s side; and Quda Yurt, the ones obtained through children’s marriage.
Within the Yurts, there is a hierarchy of relatives that sets a one-of-a-kind system of kinship.
The Yurts lay the foundation for the whole philosophy of family relationships to which nomadic societies have always attached significant importance.
It is not accidental that the Kazakh card suits have such widely recognized symbols.
Horse, apple, eagle, and tulip are the key cultural and civilizational symbols of the Kazakhss and many other Turkic peoples.
Scientific facts clearly identify the territory of modern Central Asia as the home of the very first domesticated horses, as well as falcons and eagles firstly trained for hunting.
It is also widely acknowledged that the fertile lands of Central Asia gave birth to modern apples and tulips.
Jeanette Wilson
Jeanette Wilson is a professional medium and spiritual healer who claims to heal people with the assistance of spirits.
Wilson has also promoted anti-vaccination and anti-5G views.
During a tour of the United Kingdom, several venues cancelled her appearances over concerns that her presentation could discourage people from seeking needed medical care or vaccinating their children.
Wilson was born in the United Kingdom in 1963.
She worked as a bank manager until she began working as a psychic healer and medium, following the death of her grandfather, who she claims contacted her after his death.
She moved from the UK to New Zealand in 1999.
Wilson has said that she is able to communicate with several spirits, including at least one deceased surgeon, who help her to conduct spiritual healing.
Her sessions include waving her hands, which she states are possessed by spirits, while humming, stomping, and clapping.
Wilson has stated that her psychic healing abilities include curing arthritis and the healing of vision impairments that require glasses.
She has also stated that she has treated paralysis, blindness in one eye, and many cases of life-threatening cancer.
Wilson has said she never discourages her clients from seeking medical care, however she has publicly discouraged her followers from seeking medical screening for breast cancer, stating "I’m not convinced about mammograms.
I’ve had one myself but personally I wouldn’t have another one.
That isn’t me telling you not to have them, but I know what it does to me and my body.”
Wilson describes accused serial sex abuser and debunked faith healer João Teixeira de Faria, AKA John of God, as a mentor and has said that they are both assisted in psychic healing by some of the same spirits.
She describes her claimed psychic abilities in the context of her Christianity, stating that they are a gift from God.
She has stated that her psychic sessions always include the Lord's Prayer and the Hail Mary.
In 2004, Wilson was the subject of a New Zealand Channel Three television series titled "Dare to Believe".
Later, she was featured on an episode of 20/20.
She has written four books about her experiences as a professional medium and about other new age topics.
In addition to conducting private consultations, Wilson has held public events in places such as the UK and New Zealand.
Wilson has spread anti-vaccine messages, including a claim that vaccines are linked to Alzheimer's disease.
She further claims that the media and pharmaceutical industries are suppressing cancer cures, that 5G technology is a "weapon", and that drug and gambling addiction can be caused by bad spirits.
The Good Thinking Society's project director, Michael Marshall, has expressed concerns that Wilson's shows may discourage people from seeking medical help while "wasting their money," and that her anti-vaccine rhetoric may endanger children.
Several venues in the UK cancelled appearances by Wilson after Marshall contacted them about these concerns.
The NZ Skeptics made a similar effort to urge venues to cancel Wilson's events during her tour of New Zealand.
The chair of the organization, Craig Shearer, voiced concerns about the risk of participants forgoing medical care and suffering financial exploitation.
After being contacted by Marshall, the UK Advertising Standards Authority cautioned Wilson to, according to Wilson, comply with UK regulations and "remove any claims to work with spirit world doctors, any videos that mention any diseases.
I am only able to say that I can give people a feeling of well being.”
At her shows, Wilson advertises a dietary supplement, called alfa PXP ROYALE, made from micronized black rice.
The supplement is sold by a Enzacta, a multi-level marketing company for which Wilson is a paid promoter, at a dramatic markup relative to the cost of whole purple rice sold in supermarkets or micronised purple rice sold online.
A surgeon interviewed by Australia's "A Current Affair" television show criticized the marketing of the supplement, stating that customers are "wasting their money, and for this product a large amount of money; and secondly, they may be led to believe they don’t need to take their effective treatments for conditions they may actually have.” Despite this, Wilson claims that the "purple powder" can help elderly people "keep their vibrations up", and at one performance she invited an audience member to speak with her about the "best thing for scar tissue" off camera, so that "trading standards don't become all uppity."

I've been in college for two years, a lot of things has changed in my life, have you grown up?
Maybe!
But I'm sure that intellectual maturity doesn't have much to do with age... Maybe there have been some changes in my life that make me feel the difference.
Yes, the environment has changed, friends and acquaintances have changed, I have lost some of my friends and made new friends... Life does not stop and goes on...
But that's not all because I'm writing my own memories!
Every part of life is important and has a particular value to me, because I see that every individual is inherently distinct, because Almighty God created him or her different from other people, so every individual is exceptional and can only exist once, and this experience is unique...
It seems we got into philosophical talk and got away from topic.
Let's go back to the subject... Hmmm, what made me write my memoir?
Yes...

Excerpt from the book: When she was asked first time about the journey ahead, her mother, Fatima, responded indirectly to her by these statements.
She told her about Yasmeen's flower, which her name comes from it.
She said Yasmeen's flower is always convinced to the least.
This plant does not need much care.
A single drop of fertilizer per each spring is enough for it.
Suffice it to be slightly moist, then no irrigation is needed.
All types of jasmine flowers prefer to grow in a sunny place but also tolerate the presence of shade.
The Tunisian sun is suitable for blossoming and completing personality of this flower, but it has the ability to withstand the shade and cold climate of Europe.
Like the Mediterranean white jasmine, which is very delicate in appearance but strong in character.
Yasmeen's unique fragrance conveys a sense of sincerity that other roses lack.<br>
She did not ask about the importance of the emotions that this flower brings.
She knew that giving a woman a jasmine flower sometimes meant, "Why didn't you ever love me?"
Just as her father had given her, Yasmeen, to her mother.
It was her father's last gift to her mother because he had been evading custody of Yasmeen after divorce.
After that, her mother never accepted anyone's love because she had dedicated herself to love for Yasmeen.<br>She increasingly felt the absence of his mother more day after day.
Over time, she became more confident that she would be lost without him.
She knew that being a foreigner was not an easy experience.
However, he had agreed to take the trip.
Her mother had taught him how to be a real jasmine, but she may have overlooked the bitter truth: When it leaves its soil, Jasmine quickly fades away and wraps itself beautifully in the dry.

Part of the text of the book: Everything was cool and exciting until I decided to make a change in my desperate path and do something extraordinary to get me out of this absurdity hell.
After that, in one of the autumn night, when I stepped on the boat that had stopped on the shore, the moonlight has faded from my life, and my life became a improvisations series of exceptional cases.
From then on, I went through different adventures and endangered my life many times.
I became close to the borders of death by drowning and deprived myself of justice, I even almost fell into the realm of the dead.
Over and over, I found myself hoping to return to a monotonous life with no excitement.
I was scared to be forgotten in a corner and die alone.
I was afraid that I had ruined my normal life for nothing!
This book has been published in Arabic and in novel form.
The novel mainly scrutinizes the Tunisian revolution and the effects that these failed revolutions have on the people.
This is part of the text: If she could paint a simple picture of her life, of course if she had been so aware, she recognized that it was all just suffering.
Each suffering depicts a different path, expressing certain meanings that she was unaware of it... Every suffering had to search for the next suffering to find its way...
In the meantime she was looking for a way to get rid of it and always asked: Which event, like a tornado, shook the pillars of her monotonous life?...
Just when there was an incentive to keep going, everything seemed void to her... Like a fisherman who fished a fish then thrown it into the sea and wait for a bigger fish...

Tayside Junior Football League
The Tayside Junior Football League , originally called the "Midlands League", was a football league competition operated in Tayside under the Scottish Junior Football Association which operated as the top league in the territory until a merger in 2002; it existed for a further four years as a second-tier league before the name was discontinued in 2006.
Junior football had been played in the region since the 1890s, but it was not until a restructuring across Scotland in the late 1960s that all teams in the territory were brought together under one umbrella - previously they had been competing in the local leagues in Angus, Perthshire and Dundee, though the membership of these was not always rigidly dependant on geography, and another "Midland League" also existed from the 1920s to the 1940s involving clubs from all three territories.
Due to predicted difficulties in arranging the new format, an extra year was requested for its completion by the local committees, and the Midland (Tayside) leagues began in 1969, a year after the rest of Scotland (the North was the only one of the six new regions which required more than minor adjustment to its structure).
With titles having been shared between clubs from Perthshire and Dundee (the sole Angus champions in 1974 being Kirrie Thistle), the league's balance altered dramatically in 1990 when Tayport joined the setup; their base was actually in the far north of Fife but they were permitted to join the Tayside league as they were closer to many of its teams via the Tay Road Bridge.
The "Port" almost immediately began to dominate and did not finish outside the top two places from 1991 until 2002, when the Tayside leagues were merged with the Fife League and the East (Lothians) league to form a new Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region Superleague.
Despite the challenge of facing the strongest clubs from these other two areas, Tayport continued to be among the leading teams for the first six years; Dundee side Lochee United also finished as East Region champions twice in that period.
Tayside's setup was retained as a feeder division to the Superleague along with the other historic districts until 2006, when they were fully integrated into the East Region; Tayside's section (minus the Perthshire teams which were placed with the Fife sides) became the North Division below the Super League and a new Premier Division.
In 2018, a large group of East Junior clubs joined the East of Scotland Football League, aspiring to gain entry to the senior Scottish Professional Football League in future years; however, on Tayside the only ones to do so were the Perth teams Jeanfield Swifts and Kinnoull.
This led to a North-South reorganisation of the remaining members of the region, with the 2019–20 Superleague North entirely compsed of former Tayside clubs.

Typhoon Phanfone (2019)
Typhoon Phanfone, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ursula, was a relatively strong and deadly tropical cyclone which traversed through the Philippines on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day for the first time since Nock-ten in 2016.
The twenty-ninth and final named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, the origins of Phanfone can be traced to an upper-level low which had formed near the Caroline Islands and gradually organized into a tropical depression on December 19.
Moving generally west-northwestard, the system intensified into a tropical storm on December 22 and moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility on the following day as it continued gaining strength.
Phanfone intensified to typhoon status shortly before making its first landfalls over the Eastern Visayas region on Christmas Eve.
Further intensification ensued until Christmas Day despite Phanfone making several landfalls over the central Philippine islands, peaking at 150 km/h (90 mph) 10-minute sustained winds with a central pressure dropping to 970 hPa.
Phanfone maintained its typhoon strength for several hours as it exited the Philippine landmass before unfavorable conditions caused it to rapidly deteriorate and dissipate over the South China Sea.
Phanfone crossed the central Philippines after the stronger Kammuri struck nearly the same region merely weeks prior, with a track fairly similar to 2013’s Haiyan.
The system caused destruction in the Visayas region, particularly over Samar, Leyte and Iloilo.
The total fatalities of the said typhoon is 50 deaths (with 55 people missing, and over 300 injured) and the damages is at or roughly .
Prior to its formation on December 19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a low pressure system to the southeast of Micronesia.
Showing signs of convection and sufficient banding around a defined center, the JTWC subsequently upgraded its initial warning to a medium chance of development.
Shortly thereafter on December 20, JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, while the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its first advisory on the system.
By December 22, the system gained tropical storm strength and JMA issued the named "Phanfone."
Moving generally west-northwestward, Phanfone moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) at 5:00 am PST December 23 and the Philippine weather bureau PAGASA locally named the system as "Ursula".
Owing to favorable conditions, Phanfone intensified further into a severe tropical storm hours later.
By afternoon of December 24, Phanfone gained typhoon strength shortly before making its first three landfalls over Salcedo, Eastern Samar (4:45 pm PST), Tacloban City (7:30 pm PST), and Cabucgayan, Biliran (9:15 pm PST).
Further intensification ensued until December 25, with Phanfone peaking at 00:00 UTC with 150 km/h (90 mph) 10-minute sustained winds and a central pressure dropping to 970 hPa; the JTWC reported that Phanfone peaked at 175 km/h 1-minute sustained winds, equivalent to a Category 2 typhoon.
Phanfone continued its west-northwestward track and, by afternoon of the same day, PAGASA had reported four additional landfalls: Gigantes Islands (2:30 am PST), Ibajay, Aklan (8:40 am PST), Semirara Island (1:00 pm PST), and Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro (3:00 pm PST).
By December 26, Phanfone had already exited the Philippine landmass, moving northwest over the South China Sea.
After holding strength for several hours, the system began losing strength due to unfavorable sea surface temperatures, medium wind shear and dry air intrusion.
On December 27, Phanfone dropped to tropical storm status while rapidly deteriorating and slowly moving.
On December 28, PAGASA issued its final warning as the system exited the PAR; later, JMA issued their final advisories as Phanfone weakened below warning threshold.
The PAGASA issued a signal 3 warning to Northern Samar, Samar, Eastern Samar, Leyte, Biliran and the Camotes Islands, meaning that 65-92 knot (75-106 mph; 121–170 km/h) winds were expected.
The PAGASA also issued a signal 2 warning to the Visayas, meaning that 33-65 knot (38-75 mph; 61–120 km/h) winds were to be expected within 24 hours.
It was issued to the central portion of northern Cebu, northeastern Iloilo, northern Antique, Capiz, Aklan, Southern Leyte, and Negros Occidental, which meant that Phanfone was taking a similar path to the areas hit by the much stronger Typhoon Haiyan.
The Visayas was the worst hit, with Iloilo City having 13 casualties alone that had been either struck by fallen trees, electrocuted or drowned.
Roxas, Tacloban and Maasin all received 140 mm (5.5 inches) of rain.
The extent of damage in the Philippines was quite far, with the Boracay Airport being heavily damaged as many people were stranded in the airport as the typhoon struck.
A disaster response officer also reported that power outages and damage in the town of Batad in Iloilo Province made it appear as a “ghost town”.
Severe flooding caused devastating damage in the many provinces and islands of Visayas as rain spread across the region, with many houses and vehicles being partially to completely submerged.
Multiple houses were crumpled and trees were downed, as well as power lines being downed.
All of these obstacles blocked off roads and made roads dangerous to walk on; and the excessive amounts of rainfall made ground, especially higher ground, very unstable.
The province of Leyte was placed under a state of calamity following the damage of the typhoon, with livestock, crops and infrastructure being damaged in excess of $1 million USD.
Most of the casualties are estimated to have taken place at Iloilo, as the village was badly hit with severe and swift-moving flash floods.
Tacloban was hit as fires broke out and winds allowed them to spread but it the 220,000 inhabitants escaped the worst of the system.
147 cities were affected by power outages but by Friday, December 27, 31 of those 147 had their power restored.
Because of the upcoming Christmas celebrations, 16,000 passengers who had holiday plans in their respective provinces with their families, were stranded in port for their safety due to the threat of the typhoon.
Upon making landfall near Salcedo in Eastern Samar around 4:45 PM, it was reported that the typhoon was causing major flooding and mudslides in the region.
As the storm quickly and unexpectedly intensified, over 58,000 people were evacuated in advance of the typhoon.
Five fishermen were reported missing and a 70-year-old man died after his house was swept away and as a result, he drowned.
Around 2,351 people have been affected by the typhoon and 1,654 were taking refuge in evacuation centers.
The World Food Programme issued advisories and infographics plotting the projected path of Phanfone, as well as evacuation and relief centers.
As of December 27, 2019, there are at least 28 confirmed fatalities according to the Philippines Disaster Agency, including a 13-year-old boy who was electrocuted.
A signal 2 warning was also issued to Luzon, with the southern portion of Quezon, Marinduque, Oriental Mindoro, Occidental Mindoro including Lubang Island, Romblon, Albay, Sorsogon, Burias Island, Calamian and Cuyo Islands all forecast to be in the path of Phanfone.
A signal 1 warning was issued to Bulacan, Bataan, Metro Manila, Rizal, rest of Quezon, Laguna, Batangas, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Catanduanes and northern Palawan.
The island's governor ordered local government units to conduct a forced evacuation plan, prompting civilians near flood-prone areas and areas with the potential to be affected by landslides, to relocate temporarily as a safety precaution.
Local representatives visited residents in Libon, Maninila and Tandarora to advise them to evacuate and temporarily celebrate Christmas in evacuation centers for their safety.
Many public schools were open in order to serve as shelters for residents while the provincial government distributed food packs to the evacuees.
In Naval, the local government unit deployed evacuation tents for evacuees on Monday, December 23 with some tents reserved for senior citizens, pregnant women and people with disabilities.
Personnel of the Romblon Provincial Mobile Force Company were deployed and conducted an inventory of Search and Rescue (SAR) equipment on December 23 in preparation for the typhoon.
San Jose experienced 217 mm (8.64 inches) of rain in just under 24 hours.
Upwards of 58,000 people were evacuated from Luzon and its surrounding islands as the system brought torrential rain and severe flash flooding ensued as a result of the rains.
One family was swept away whilst trying to reach higher ground.
Water and power services were completely cut off, and restoration was estimated to take weeks.
Due to extensive damage done by Typhoon Phanfone in the Philippines, PAGASA announced that the name "Ursula" will be removed from the list of typhoon names, and the agency named 'Ugong' to replace 'Ursula'.

Henry Cow: The World Is a Problem
Henry Cow: The World Is a Problem is a 2019 book by American academic Benjamin Piekut.
It is a biography and analysis of the English experimental rock group Henry Cow and their turbulent existence between 1968 and 1978.
The book is Piekut's second and was published in September 2019 in the United States by Duke University Press in hard- and soft-cover.
Piekut is a historian of experimental music and an associate professor of music at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.
He had previously written "Experimentalism Otherwise: The New York Avant-Garde and Its Limits" (2011), had edited "Tomorrow Is the Question: New Directions in Experimental Music Studies" (2014), and co-edited with George E. Lewis "Oxford Handbook of Critical Improvisation Studies" (2016).
Piekut has also publshed several papers on Henry Cow, including "Music for Socialism, London 1977" (2019), and "Another Version of Ourselves: The Enigmas of Improvised Subjectivity" (2018).
Piekut sourced the content of "The World Is a Problem" from interviews (published and unpublished), notebooks and diaries, magazine and newspaper articles, journal papers, and books.
He conducted his own interviews between 2011 and 2016 with all living members of Henry Cow and those associated with the band, and was granted access to personal archives of several players, including Fred Frith, Tim Hodgkinson, Chris Cutler, Lindsay Cooper and Peter Blegvad.
Piekut wrote in the book's Preface that where written records and memories disagreed, "only by reading many of them together and against one another has it been possible to determine what actually happened with any accuracy."
The sock painting on the book's cover is by artist Ray Smith and was originally used on the cover of Henry Cow's second album, "Unrest" (1974).
Piekut took the book's subtitle, "The World Is a Problem" from a statement Hodgkinson made in one of his notebooks, paraphrasing Paulo Freire in "Pedagogy of the Oppressed", that Henry Cow wants to "transform the world; the world is a problem, not a given".
"The World Is a Problem" chronicles the history of Henry Cow and their exploration of music and activism, from their inception in 1968 to their break-up in 1978.
It also analyses of the nature of the band and the way they functioned.
They were a collective with a strict work-ethic that demanded total commitment from its members.
They held regular meetings where all aspects of the group, its music and activities were debated.
This tended to suppress individualism and made the band more important than its members, which strained relationships within the group, and with partners on the outside.
The book explains how Henry Cow were at odds with the status quo, the music industry and the world at large.
They were politically outspoken and embraced Marxism and Maoism.
They were not content to settle and continually experimented with new ideas.
The brief merger with Slapp Happy in 1975, the formation of the Orckestra with the Mike Westbrook Brass Band and folk singer Frankie Armstrong in 1977, and the establishment of the Rock in Opposition movement in 1978, were some of several ventures they initiated.
Henry Cow's approach to composition is discussed, and the musical structure and lyrics (where present) of many of their more prominent works, including Frith's "Ruins" and Hodgkinson's "Living in the Heart of the Beast", are analysed in detail.
The band improvised much of their music, particularly during live performances, and this style of playing included free improvisation, studio improvisation to tape (for example on their 1974 album, "Unrest"), and open improvisation.
Reviewing "Henry Cow: The World Is a Problem" in the British progressive rock magazine, "Prog", Sid Smith called it an "impressively detailed account [that] chronicle[s] [Henry Cow's] triumphs and camaraderie".
He added that through their "often-turbulent existence", the band's struggle "against the prevailing tides of commerciality and popular culture ... has a heroic quality about it".
Smith wrote that if the success of a music biography is measured by the desire to revisit the group's albums, then this book is "enormously successful".
He said Piekut's "forensic examination" of Henry Cow's recordings adds another dimension to their music.
Smith concluded that the book "is a fitting tribute to Henry Cow's importance and legacy in a notable but marginalised movement of 20th-century music."
Phil Howitt wrote in the Canterbury scene magazine, "FaceLift" that while Henry Cow may not have been part of the Canterbury scene, Piekut's book can be read as "almost a parallel narrative to that of the Canterbury scene", given the number of musicians from that "genre" who either played in, or were associated with, the band.
Howitt described "The World Is a Problem" as a "definitive biography" that is "meticulously researched" leaving few stones unturned.
He said that just as Henry Cow were "an intensely serious band", this is an "intensely serious book" that requires "considerable powers of concentration and assiduousness".
Howitt found the analyses of their different types of improvisation and their political alignments "heavy going".
He also felt that the in-depth descriptions of some of the band's compositions were "somewhat unnecessary" as they would only benefit a limited audience.
What was also missing, Howett felt, was a timeline of events covering Henry Cow's history.
But overall Howett called "The World Is a Problem" "a remarkable project" that is "compelling [and] unique".
Chris Cutler, Henry Cow's drummer, described the book as a "cornucopia of invaluable information".
He said it is a well-researched and detailed account of the band, but suggested that in places, it is "best [to] read between the lines".
Because some of the band members kept more detailed records than others, their viewpoints tend to feature more prominently in the book, leaving some parts "uneven".
Cutler added that where Piekut had to interpret different people's accounts of events, it is likely that not everyone in the band will concur with his analysis.
Cutler said that "subjectivities are profoundly complex", and attempts to "unearth things that were already hidden when they were current" will be "guided by [personal] biases and interests".

The 2020 Corrib Oil Galway International Rally was confirmed to take place on Sunday 2nd February with a repeat of the racing format which made the previous year's event a success.
The event will be the opening round of the 2020 Irish Tarmac Rally Championship, and will run a week earlier than 2019 in order to avoid a clash with the opening British Rally Championship round, the Cambrian Rally.

Craig Breen finished first overall, 14.4s ahead of Alastair Fisher.
The event was planned to go ahead in February, however, in November 2017 it was announced that the event is being cancelled due lack of "the necessary financial certainty that is required at this time".
Event organisers Galway Motor Club also quoted logistical issues as a reason for cancellation.
Rising motorsport event insurance costs has also been a contributing factor.
The event planning was counteracted by efforts to stop the rally.
Some of the local residents claimed that application for road closures was not properly dealt with.
There were very strict conditions attached to the road closure license and these mainly relate to insurance issues.
After consultation with local politicians and the Galway County Council it was ruled that the organisers have complied with all of the procedures relating to a temporary road closure, and that the event is cleared to go ahead.
Couple months after the event a High Court case against the rally organizers was brought up.
A 60-year-old retired Garda sergeant claimed that he suffered back pain and depression after an assault by spectators during the Galway Rally in 2009.
The High Court awarded €105,000 damages to the claimant.
Irish motorsport was hit with yet another increase in premiums later that year, which when passed on to competitors were to reach €800 mark per competitor per event.

Roger Steinmann
Roger Steinmann ([]; born November 6, 1961 in Zurich, Switzerland) is a filmmaker and entrepreneur.
Most notable is his biopic "Illusion Infinity" (aka "Paradise", 2004), starring Dee Wallace, Mickey Rooney, Timothy Bottoms, Barbara Carrera, Martin Kove, and Theresa Saldana.
At the age of eight, Steinmann borrowed his uncle’s Super-8 camera.
He shot his very first motion picture ‘Zurich’ (1969), a five minute-documentary.
When the Swiss national TV in 1974 launched a youth-film-competition based on the key-word ‘door’, Steinmann directed his first feature ‘Die Türe’ (‘The Door’, 1975).
Steinmann casted both lead roles in ‘Die Türe’ with Peter Bürgisser and André Bellmont.
A string of short features and documentaries followed.
Notably are:
‘Die Flutkatastrophe’ (‘Flood Disaster’, 1977) was labeled ‘Switzerland’s first disaster movie.
It depicts a major water dam-break what subsequently floods the metropole of Zurich.
It won numerous awards.
And, it was aired on Swiss national TV on November 4, 1978 together with a live-interview with Steinmann.
‘’ ('The Machine-Animals', 1977) is a 22-minute documentary analyzing large-scale husbandry against classic farming.
Still in his teens, Steinmann aimed to execute larger scale feature-projects based on his original screenplays.
In 1978/79, he developed the conception ‘Krebs!’ (‘Cancer!’) about the life-threatening virus in a woman’s organism, visualized by a simultaneous life-threat of the organism of an entire city by a Godzilla-like monster-crab.
In German language the title ‘Krebs!’ bears the double meaning of Cancer and Crab.
The project had huge dimensions in respect of budget but as well of, at the time, demanding special effects.
Therefore, the project stalled.
Steinmann turned to theater as well; notable are:
1982: ‘Beschti Referenze’ (aka ‘Buchhalter Noetzli’, ‘Bookkeeper Noetzli’) with Steinmann producing and directing.
1986: ‘Achtung-Fertig-Los!’ (‘Ready-Steady-Go!’) as producer and writer, with directing.
Imthurn became Steinmann’s long time partner.
1988: ‘Schelmereie’ (‘Sweet Cheating’, 1988) as a director at the theater in Oberentfelden, Switzerland.
From 1991, Steinmann lived alternatively in Los Angeles.
There, he wrote several screenplays on spec, alone but mostly in association, e.g.
'Bum and the Kid' with Scott Steindorff, outlines, e.g.
‘Love of my Life’ with Don Mankiewicz, rewrites, e.g.
‘Project: Metalbeast’.
Among Steinmann´s several projects, Illusion Infinity (aka Paradise, 2004) caught the eye of casting director Gerald I. Wolff.
He was able to engage six well known Hollywood actors: Dee Wallace, Mickey Rooney, Timothy Bottoms, Barbara Carrera, Martin Kove, and Theresa Saldana.
‘Illusion Infinity’ was labeled as biopic; however, it was an original screenplay by Steinmann about the supposed real Las Vegas singer Patricia Paradise (played by Dee Wallace) and her life-long search for a genuine soul-mate, and a home she calls ‘Shangri-La’.
In 2014, Thai film star Mike Angelo became interested to star in ‘The Partykillers’, a screwball-comedy about a humble inventor of a magical teddy-bear crashing the engagement party of a toy manufacturer.
This screenplay Steinmann wrote back in 1995/98 in collaboration with Rodney Heeringa.
But another concept of a screwball comedy fit Angelo’s talent even better: A male singer gaining success only when performing as a woman, attracting both a father and his daughter.
After Angelo agreed to star in this dual role, Steinmann originated the 2015-screenplay ‘Ladies First’.
Swiss actors Beat Schlatter and Pascal Ulli confirmed their interest to participate, the latter also as co-produce.
Our world caught up with constant (ab-)use of cell-phones: What would happen if all cells and computers became unusable?
This topic led to the 2016/2018-screenplay 'PhonY' with the unique interactivity between segments in Los Angeles, Switzerland, Australia, Thailand and Canada.
In spring 2018, the filming commenced in Switzerland with Pascal Ulli and Gilles Tschudi; it was followed by the Thai segment.
The remaining segments with Burt Reynolds and Barbara Carrera were scheduled in Los Angeles for October 2018.
Though, a mere month before, Burt Reynolds untimely passed away, and the production stalled temporarily.
It is aimed for a 2020 delivery.
In 2018, Steinmann started to film the farce-comedy "PhonY" in Switzerland and Thailand.
The Los Angeles-segment had to be canceled due to lead actor Burt Reynolds' untimely death.
In December 2019, Golden Globe winner Elke Sommer agreed to participate.
1983: Steinmann invented an automatic bottle stopper; patented in 1985.
1983: Steinmann prevailed over 73 candidates in the German TV-quiz show ‘Alles oder Nichts’ with a record-breaking TV-live-audience of 15 Mio.
1984: Steinmann founded the Rotsch AG, a joint-stock company, to market his invention.
At that time, he was 22 years old and became the youngest president ever of such an entity in Switzerland.
He sold that entity in 1996.
1995: Steinmann founded the SUNSET International AG, a joint-stock company, to produce films.

Colonel Athanasios Frangos.
The regiment refused to obey the command to surrender its weapons, and retreated west towards the mountains.
The French launched Moroccan sipahis in pursuit of the unit, encircling it and forcing it to surrender after clashes (named "Battle of the Flag", as the Greeks carried the regimental standard with them) that claimed the lives of 59 Greek officers and soldiers, as well as seven killed and 15 wounded on the French side.

In order to occupy this gap left in the city, the three friends came together and developed the project, joining a professional club Arraial do Cabo (CEAC) with Araruama Futebol Clube.

Ranjit Sitaram Pandit
Ranjit Sitaram Pandit (1893 – 14 January 1944) was an Indian barrister, Congressman, linguist and scholar from Rajkot in the Kathiawar district of India.
He is known for his role in the Indian non-cooperation movement, and for translating the Sanskrit texts "Mudrarakshasa", "Ṛtusaṃhāra" and Kalhana's "Rajatarangini" into English.
He was the husband of Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, the son-in-law of Motilal Nehru, brother-in-law of Jawaharlal Nehru and father of Nayantara Sahgal.
Until 1926, he was a barrister in Calcutta, a position he resigned to join the Indian non-cooperation movement.
In 1930, he was the Secretary of the Peshawar Enquiry Committee, which investigated the troubles in the North West Frontier Province.
Later, he was appointed a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (UP).
Pandit died in 1944, shortly after being released from his fourth imprisonment by the British.
Ranjit Sitaram Pandit was born in 1893, to the wealthy British-educated lawyer Sitaram Narayan Pandit, in Rajkot in the Kathiawar district of India.
His ancestors came from Bambuli village in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra and his family consisted of a number of lawyers and Sanskrit scholars.
Amongst his siblings was a brother, Pratap, and two sisters, Ramabai and Tarabai.
He was a linguist and spoke eleven languages, including Hindi, Persian, Bengali, English, French and German, and like his father, he studied law in England.
Prior to entering the Middle Temple, he attended Christ Church College, University of Oxford.
He had also attended the Sorbonne University and the University of Heidelberg.
He had an interest in horticulture, could play the violin and was proficient at tennis, polo, cricket, swimming and hunting.
In 1920, Mahadev Desai, a friend of Pandit's from college, recommended that Sarup Nehru, Motilal Nehru's daughter, read Pandit's article published in "Modern Review" titled "At the Feet of the Guru".
Desai was then secretary to Mahatma Gandhi, who was a family friend to the Pandits in Kathiawar.
Pandit and Sarup Nehru were subsequently introduced to each other and he proposed to her the following day, writing in one note that "I have come many miles and crossed many bridges to come to you—but in the future you and I must cross our bridges hand in hand".
On 10 May 1921, the anniversary of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, they married, upon which, she adopted the name Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit.
With the Nehrus now involved in the Indian non-cooperation movement and in boycotting British goods, the wedding was the last event in the Nehru household "approaching opulence at Anand Bhavan".
Their first daughter, Vatsala, died at the age of nine months.
Subsequently, they had three daughters; Chandralekha Mehta, Nayantara Sahgal and Rita Dar, born in 1924, 1927 and 1929 respectively.
On 1 March 1926, Pandit, together with his wife Vijaya Lakshmi, his brother-in-law Jawaharlal Nehru, sister-in-law Kamala Nehru and niece Indira, sailed to Europe on the Lloyd liner "Triestino".
He returned with Vijaya Lakshmi the following November.
Until this European trip, Pandit was a successful lawyer who practiced in what was then called Calcutta with Sir B. L. Mitter.
Against the wishes of his family in Rajkot, he became a Satyagrahi and joined Mahatma Gandhi and Motilal Nehru in the Indian non-cooperation movement and settled in Allahabad, where he took up cases in the courts.
Later, they moved to Khali, in the hills near Almora.
When the Indian National Congress's 1928 proposal for Dominion status was rejected by the British, the party took a pledge of non-cooperation and demanded "complete independence".
Vijaya Lakshmi later recorded in her autobiography, that on 29 December 1929, upon the declaration of independence by the Congress's then president Jawaharlal Nehru, Pandit joined him in the celebrations.
In 1930, Motilal Nehru appointed Pandit the Secretary of the Peshawar Enquiry Committee, to investigate troubles in the North West Frontier Province.
Its report was published by Allahabad's Law Journal Press.
In 1937, he was listed in "The Indian Annual Register" as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (UP), to which he was elected along with Vijaya Lakshmi.
He served several prison terms, including two prison sentences with Jawaharlal Nehru, one in Naini Central Jail in 1931 and another at Dehradun.
His daughter, Nayantara, later described how she ate chocolate cake the day her father first went to prison.
She later became a writer, and associating chocolate cake with prison, wrote a book titled "Prison and Chocolate Cake".
While in prison, Pandit translated into English Kalhana's "Rajatarangini", the 12th century history of the kings of Kashmir, written in Sanskrit, and described the poem as one of "great scope, a more or less complete picture of society, in which the bloody periods of the past are delightfully relieved by delicate tales of love, by episodes of marvel and mystery and by interesting digressions which the author permits himself".
The foreword to the translation was written by Jawaharlal Nehru.
He translated from Sanskrit to English, the play "Mudrarakshasa" and in 1942 completed the translation of "Ṛtusaṃhāra".
In 1943, he was reported to have had pneumonia, pleurisy and a heart attack in Bareilly Central Jail.
Vijaya Lakshmi visited him, and later described how "it was a tremendous shock to see Ranjit brought in to the superintendant's office on a stretcher.
His head had been shaved and he was emaciated and almost unrecognisable”.
He had been arrested that year by British authorities and was serving his fourth term in prison.
He died shortly after being released.
On 18 January 1944, Nehru wrote to his daughter Indu, that he was informed that Pandit (Pupha to Indu) died in Lucknow on 14 January 1944, before the reformation of personal law which was completed after independence, leaving his widow to raise their three daughters without an inheritance.
Pandit's brother, Pratap, had frozen their assets.
Author Katherine Frank wrote in her biography of Indira Gandhi, that Pandit's death "was an unnecessary death directly attributable to the poor conditions and treatment he had received in jail.
Winston Churchill was later reported by Pandit's widow, on a visit to England after independence of India, to have said to her that “we killed your husband didn't we”.
Pandit's daughter, Nayantara, wrote in her biography of Nehru that her mother replied "no, every man lives only to his appointed hour" and Churchill replied "nobly spoken".

Møller then travelled to Paris, to study under René Just Haüy and Georges Cuvier, before rejoining Steffens at the University of Jena to sit at the feet of Friedrich Schelling.
After a conversion experience during an illness, he was received into the Catholic Church in Hamburg, on 27 January 1804, the day of his marriage to Elisabeth Charlotte Alberti.
His wife's sister was married to Ludwig Tieck.

Amritsar 1919
Amritsar 1919: An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre (2019), is a book by Kim A. Wagner and published by Yale University Press, that aims to dispel myths surrounding the Jallianwala Bagh massacre that took place in Amritsar, India, on 13 April 1919.
In the absence of any photographs of the event and with significant differences between British and Indian accounts of how many were killed and how and why it happened, Wagner examines primary sources to trace the events leading up to the massacre and then discusses its aftermath.
According to Wagner, the background to the massacre starts with the Indian rebellion of 1857 and the subsequent British fear of a recurrence.
By 1919, Indians aspired to greater self-governance, a wish frustrated by the proposals of the Rowlatt Act.
The result was Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha movement, which persuaded Indians to pursue nonviolent resistance to the British.
Fearing another 1857, events in Amritsar unfolded into Indian political agitation, the arrest of two key Indian political leaders, and British panic.
Then came General Dyer's action towards a large peaceful crowd and the killings at Jallianwalla Bagh.
British authorities responded with martial law and the arrest and torture of a number of Indians in Amritsar.
Contrary to a number of widely held beliefs, Wagners research reveals an alternative number of how many were killed in the massacre, how many were found in the well and an account of why General Dyer acted as he did.
The book was released in 2019, the 100th anniversary of the massacre, and triggered responses in a number of publications including "The Hindustan Times", "The Telegraph" and the "London Review of Books".
Amongst the reviewers have been Sathnam Sanghera, Andrew Lycett, Tunku Varadarajan, Ferdinand Mount and Trevor Grundy.
"Amritsar 1919: An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre" was published in 2019 by Yale University Press.
It is available in hard back, paper back and an audio version narrated by Neil Shah.
The author is Kim A. Wagner, who lectures on colonial India and the British Empire at Queen Mary, University of London.
He previously authored "" and "Thuggee".
The book has 360 pages, 26 black and white illustrations, four maps and 12 chapters preceded by an introduction and a section on acknowledgements.
Following the twelfth chapter is a conclusion and epilogue.
Wagner explains that "the Amritsar Massacre isn’t understood very well", particularly in the absence of any photographs of the 13 April 1919 and with a significant variation in British and Indian accounts of how many were killed and how and why it happened.
In his book, he examines primary sources to trace the events leading up to the massacre and discusses its aftermath.
The book begins with a scene from Richard Attenborough’s 1982 film "Gandhi", what Wagner cites as the most popular depiction of the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre and “how many people today think of what was arguably the bloodiest massacre in the history of the British Empire”.
According to Wagner, understanding the massacre requires beginning with the Indian rebellion of 1857.
In 1919, the continuing fear of a revolution led to the proposal of the suppressive Rowlatt Act which would give the British powers to quash any political agitation, and contradicted the simultaneous British promises with the Indian National Congress to give greater involvement to Indians in government.
Mahatma Gandhi responded by proposing that all Indians oppose the Act and make a Satyagraha pledge, a promise to resist without using violence.
The subsequent call for general strikes in late March 1919 then led to the arrest of two local Indian leaders.
On 10 April 1919, upon hearing of the arrests, a crowd of Indians issued a petition for the release of their leaders.
When British officials panicked and fired in reaction to seeing the approaching crowd, riots erupted.
On that day, Wagner explained, “European civilians had been killed by Indian rioters, and white women had been attacked by brown men”, for the first time since 1857.
The British subsequently banned all future gatherings.
However, the ban was not widely acknowledged and “many either unaware of the proclamation or not believing that the British would actually resort to violence, proceeded to announce a meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh that would take place on April 13, 1919”.
The crowd at Jallianwalla Bagh was composed of mainly men and many from out of town, making up to 20,000 people, who had mostly come to celebrate a religious festival.
Speeches focussed on the Rowlatt Act, the call to release the two arrested local Indian leaders, and effects on Indians of the First World War.
In Wagner's words "on the 13th of April, 1919, there was nobody in Jallianwala Bagh who thought about independence.
They were not heroic freedom fighters.
They still had an abiding belief in the ultimate justice of the Raj, and they still thought of the British government as being the arbiter of justice".
When General Dyer arrived "he was overwhelmed by the sheer size of the gathering that he had walked in on" and assumed it was a rebellion.
Wagner explains that the British response was of "racialized fear and violent suppression".
Afterwards, there was no British help with removing the dead or medical assistance for the injured.
Instead, the British authorities imposed curfews, a crawling order and martial law and those suspected of being involved in the 10 April riots were arrested and tortured.
British censorship ensured suppression of the details of the Amritsar troubles and the massacre, until October 1919.
In July 1920, the matter was discussed in the House of Commons.
Some noted the “un-English” nature of what happened and took his actions as a "blemish on an otherwise untarnished British rule".
Others saw Dyer's actions as necessary.
Using primary sources to gather evidence, Wagner has clarified that the book aims to dispel a number of myths surrounding the events of the massacre in Amritsar on 13 April 1919.
Contrary to a number of widely held beliefs, Wagner's research reveals 500 to 600 is a more likely “plausible estimate” of the number killed at the Bagh on 13 April 1919, and that “eyewitness accounts recall only one or two bodies as having been recovered from the well inside the park”.
That number, however, he says, does not "actually change the enormity of what happened".
In 2019, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh, the book triggered responses in a number of publications including "The Spectator" by William Dalrymple, who noted that Wagner had used extensive primary sources in his research and "almost every sentence is footnoted — gets as close as we are ever likely to get to the truth of what happened in Jallianwalla Bagh.
In the process, he demolishes a large number of myths that have grown up around the event, both imperial and nationalist".
Andrew Lycett, writing in "The Telegraph", described the book as having skilfully mapped out the events.
Reporting in "The Times", Tunku Varadarajan agreed with Wagner that the book is a "a microhistory of a global event", aimed at neither those with "Raj nostalgia or Indian Nationalism".
These responses were also supported by John Newsinger.
However, Newsinger, with regards to the fear of another 1857, pointed out "one disagreement with Wagner's discussion of this is that on occasions it [the book] seems to suggest that the massacre was the result of a misunderstanding, that if the British had not been so obsessed with the events of the 1850s then the massacre might never have taken place".
Trevor Grundy recommended the book be taught at schools and colleges.
Ferdinand Mount in the "London Review of Books", noted that General Dyer's evidence is quoted at length in the book.
Both Grundy and Mount compared "Amritsar 1919" with Nick Lloyd's "The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day" (2011) and with Nigel Collett's "The Butcher of Amritsar" (2005).
Mount argued that Wagner had underplayed the personality of General Dyer, portraying him as "nothing exceptional ... and nothing extraordinary", instead emphasising that it was "brutality" in general that was the "driving principle of the Raj" rather than the personality of individuals.
Wagner responded to Mount's view that "Dyer and the massacre were unique" and that the massacre "was all down to the personality of one officer", by citing the other brutal incidents mentioned by Mount "in which British officers in India from 1857 onward resorted to exemplary and indiscriminate massacres", such as those ordered by Hector Munro, Frederick Cooper and General James Neill.
"Amritsar 1919" has also been reviewed along with other books revolved around the massacre, including Anita Anand's "The Patient Assassin".
Reviews also appeared in "The Hindustan Times", and other commentators have included Sathnam Sanghera.

Paul V. Malloy
Paul V. Malloy is the presiding circuit court judge for Ozaukee County, Wisconsin.
He graduated with a Batchelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1981, and received his law degree from John Marshall Law School (Chicago) in 1985.
He was appointed to the bench in 2002, then elected to a full six-year term in 2003.
He was re-elected in 2009 and 2015.
His term expires in 2021.
In October 2014, Circuit Court Judge Joseph Voiland described a confrontation in which he and Molloy were standing “nearly nose to nose” and Malloy was yelling “as loud as I have heard anyone yell before.
Malloy admitted yelling but said the "nose to nose" dispute was exaggerated because there was a desk and chair between them.
In August 2015, Voiland jailed a woman after a hearing in which Voiland said he didn’t believe her, though Malloy released the woman after her attorney argued that Voiland didn’t establish any legal basis for holding her or provide for her an alternative method to seek release.
Randy Koschnick, the district judge at the time but now the director of state courts, had to intervene at times in disputes between Malloy and Voiland, including in June 2016 after Malloy ordered Court Commissioner Barry Boline not to follow orders issued by Voiland.
Voiland, speaking to a state investigator two years later, said he didn’t feel safe in his office after that and considered having security cameras installed.
In 2018, Voilland contended that the courts and county had historically failed to provide funding for the obligation to conduct home studies in child custody cases.
Unable to resolve the situation within the county, Voiland escalated his complaints to the state level.
In 2019, Malloy removed 234,000 voters from the statewide rolls, ruling that state law compelled him to do so.
The League of Women Voters, to whom Malloy refused to grant standing to intervene in the case, The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which was also denied standing by Malloy, has also filed suit in federal court to halt the contested purging.
Wisconsin's Attorney General Josh Kaul also file a notice of appeal to halt the purging, acting on behalf of the state's Elections Commission and requesting to stay of Malloy's order.
The issue was brought before the court by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL).
The Institute is a right-wing organization mostly supported by the Bradley Foundation, which funds such political causes.
The lawsuit demanded that the Wisconsin Election Commission respond to a "Movers Report," generated from voter data analysis produced by the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a national, non-partisan partnership funded in 2012 by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
ERIC shares voter registration information to improve the accuracy of voter rolls.
The report tagged 234,039 voters who may have moved to an address that had not yet been updated on their voter registration forms.
Despite thin evidence for removal of that extraordinary number of qualified voters, Wisconsin may be forced to comply with Malloy's order.
On January 2, 2010, WILL said it asked the circuit court to hold the Elections Commission in contempt, fining it up to $12,000 daily, until it advances Malloy’s December 17, 2019 order to purge from the voting rolls hundreds of thousands of registered voters who possibly have moved to a different address.
The case being litigated in a state appeals court, but it was thought that the conservative-dominated Wisconsin Supreme Court would be likely to hear it.
Ozaukee County is heavily Republican, having voted for a Democratic presidential candidate only once after 1936 when it voted for Lyndon Johnson in 1964.
The purge was felt to be targeting voters living in the cities of Madison, and Milwaukee, and college towns, which all exhibit Democratic voting strength.
Two of the three plaintiffs in the case heard by Malloy were significant contributors to state Republican party candidates' campaigns, including former state representative and senator, David W. Opitz.
Disenfranchisement expert Greg Palast ties the Wisconsin effort at voter purging as part of a national Republican strategy.
Barrage de Portage-des-Roches
The Portage-des-Roches dam ("Portage-des-Roches being the translation of the Montagnais" "Ashini Kushnapagan") or " Taschereau Dam" (in honor of "Louis-Alexandre Taschereau") is a dam located in the Laterrière sector of borough Chicoutimi, at Saguenay (city), Quebec, Canada.
The largest water retaining structure in Kenogami Lake, this dam constitutes the source of the Chicoutimi River, whose flow is totally dependent on it.
Portage-des-Roches is located at confluence between Chicoutimi River and the eastern end of Kénogami Reservoir.
This natural corridor carved out by glaciation is a depression located between the elevation of Lac Jean-Deschênes that of the southern valley of the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean or Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
As part of the main portage suite which links the Saguenay to Lac Saint-Jean, by Kenogami Lake and Chicoutimi River, Portage-des-Roches was borrowed by Father Jean Dequen in 1652.
In 1732, it was the surveyor Joseph-Laurent Normandin, who translated the Montagnais term "Ashini Kushnapagan" into "Portage-des-Roches".
In 2010, the Government of Quebec issued a call for tenders to improve the evacuation capacity of the spillway, raise the crest of the dam and replace wooden valves with steel valves with an independent system that can be controlled remotely.
The various works take account of the technical recommendations contained in the report of the Nicolet Commission.
The total cost of the rehabilitation project is estimated at $ 50 million.
The work must be completed in 2013.

The image comparison of the movie was carried out using the five (5) Positive Prints, the only existing film materials, which already showed mild to severe type of decay.
All five (5) Positive Prints have critical problems on color decay and focus problems that heavily affected the image.
The film elements have emulsion and base damages that have caused severe line scratches in the picture.
Reconstruction for the best copies that were used for each reel was tediously performed to achieve the best quality for digital restoration.
The most drastically affected reels are R3, being the only copy available and R5 due to the advanced chemical decay and focus problems.
Digital output shows the maximum level of restoration it can achieve.
The missing frames that could not be addressed in digital restoration, have also affected the motion of some shots.
Other picture defects such as dust/dirt, patches, continuous patches, single frame scratches, flicker, stabilization, splice mark, bump, squeeze, gate hair, continuous dust, continuous line scratch, stains, mold, mis-light, vertical band, and color breathing were successfully fixed and removed by the restoration artists of Kantana Post-Production (Thailand) Co., Ltd.

Payette City Hall and Courthouse
The Payette City Hall and Courthouse, at 3rd Ave. and 8th St. in Payette, Idaho, was built in 1912.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
It is a two-story brick building upon a raised foundation, built in Classical Revival style.
It is three bays wide, with bays separated by terra cotta pilasters, and four bays deep.
Its entry bay rises to a pedimented cornice.
The builder was J. Ronald Walker.
It was deemed "architecturally significant as a good local example of the Neo-Classical Revival style in Payette.
Although of modest scale and ornament, it nevertheless is one of the town's more outstanding structures and the major one in the downtown area to display Classical details and proportions.
Situated at the end of Third Avenue, Payette's main street, it dominates the streetscape in the north end, and for many years served as a symbol of civic authority.
Further contributing to the building's significance is its having functioned for a number of years as a seat of local government.
Not only did it house the city government, but after the formation of Payette County in 1917 it also contained the county government."
The city offices moved out in the 1950s and the county offices moved out in the 1970s.

RTE Studio bombing
The RTE Studio bombing was a bomb attack carried out by the Ulster Loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in Dublin, Ireland.
It was the first Loyalist bombing in the Republic of Ireland during The Troubles.
In March and April 1969 the UVF and Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) carried out a number of sabotage bombings and blamed them on the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
The attack took place on 5 August 1969 at 1:30 am.
The blast could be heard over a wide area of Dublin city, nobody was injured.
The bomb is believed to have been planted at the rear wall of the studio building and not much structural damage was done to the building, accept for the shattering of glass panels.
Later that morning all Irish daily newspapers had front-page coverage of the blast.
This was the start of a Loyalist campaign of bombings in the Republic of Ireland that would continue until the mid 1970s, with the deadliest being the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which killed 34.
On 19 October 1969, UVF & UPV member Thomas "Tommy" McDowell was electrocuted while planting a bomb at an electricity sub-station in Ballyshannon, County Donegal.
He died of his injuries three days later.
On 24 October, the UVF claimed responsibility for both the Ballyshannon and the RTÉ bombing.
The statement read "the attempted attack was a protest against the Irish Army units still massed on the border in Co Donegal".
The statement added: "so long as the threats from Éire continue, so long will the volunteers of Ulster's people's army strike at targets in Southern Ireland".
Until then the Irish security forces believed the RTE bombing was the work of Irish republicans who had a grudge against RTE.
The UVF carried out two more bomb attacks in the Republic that year: on the Wolfe Tone memorial in Bodenstown, County Kildare on 31 October, and on 26 December on the Daniel O'Connell monument in Dublin.
Six months after the RTE bombing the UVF struck again at RTE.
On 18 February 1970 it bombed a 240-foot radio mast on Mongary Hill, near Raphoe, County Donegal, putting the transmitter out of action.
The mast had allowed RTE radio signals to be broadcast into Northern Ireland.
The UVF claimed responsibility the next day.
UVF sabotage bombings continued sporadically in the Republic throughout 1970 and 1971.
Beautiful People (Big Country song)
"Beautiful People" is a song by Scottish rock band Big Country, released in 1991 as the second and final single from their fifth studio album "No Place Like Home".
It was written by Stuart Adamson and produced by Pat Moran.
"Beautiful People" reached No.
72 on the UK Singles Chart, and No.
36 on the BBC's Heavy Metal/Rock chart.
The song's music video was directed by Roger Pomphrey and shot at Peckham, London.
Speaking to the Big Country fanzine "Inwards" in 1991, Adamson said of the song: "This is about how you can find cool things in the most fucked-up places."
Upon release, Peter Kinghorn of "Newcastle Evening Chronicle" described "Beautiful People" as a "gently rolling singalong tune" with "plinking banjo and piano".
Craig McLean of "Vox" felt the song's piano "honks and tonks agreeably".
Steve Stewart of "The Press and Journal" considered "No Place Like Home" to present "a different style of music" from Big Country.
He commented: "There is a slower, more relaxed feel to their sound, as displayed in "Beautiful People"."
In a review of one of the band's 1991 concerts, David Sinclair of "The Times" noted the song's "honky-tonk piano, mandolin and mellow sentiments".
John Peel, reviewing the single for "New Musical Express", commented: "It sounds like Mungo Jerry.
My dad would have described it as half-baked piffle and he'd have been right.
Sorry, Stuart."
In a retrospective review of the single, JT Griffith of AllMusic felt "Return to the Two Headed King" and "Fly Like An Eagle" were "unimpressive", with "Beautiful People" being "by far [the] strongest song".

Hocquart Lake
The lac Hocquart is a freswater body crossed by the Pika River on the watershed of the Pikauba River and the Saguenay River.
Lac Hocquart is located in the unorganized territory of Lac-Achouakan, in the Lac-Saint-Jean-Est Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
This lake is located in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
This small valley is served indirectly by the route 169 and a few secondary routes for forestry, recreational tourism activities.
Forestry is the main economic activity in the sector; recreotourism activities, in second.
The surface of Lake Hocquart is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, but safe circulation on the ice is generally made from mid-December to mid-March.
The main watersheds near Lake Hocquart are:
Hocquart Lake is in the shape of a pallet hat, a width of and an altitude of .
This lake is mainly fed by the Pika River (coming from the west), by the Gobeil stream (coming from the east) and by the outlet (coming from the south) of Lac Larivière.
The mouth of this lake is located at:
From the mouth of Lake Hocquart, the current follows the course of the Pika River consecutively on to the north, the course of the Pikauba River on north to the confluence with Kenogami Lake; it crosses this lake on north-east to Barrage de Portage-des-Roches; the course of the Chicoutimi River on to the east, then the northeast and the course of the Saguenay River on east to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.
This toponym evokes the life work of Gilles Hocquart (1694-1783), born in Mortagne-au-Perche (France).
After having been controller of the port of Rochefort, he came in 1729 to settle in Quebec (city), as authorizing commissioner and interim intendant of New France, in order to replace Claude -Thomas Dupuy; he was confirmed in his functions in 1731.
In about twenty years, Gilles Hocquart advanced settlement and agriculture, notably by granting seigneuries in the region of lac Champlain and in Nouvelle-Beauce.
He ensured the completion of chemin du Roi, on the left bank of St. Lawrence River, in addition to encouraging shipbuilding, export development, industrial production at Forges du Saint-Maurice, while maintaining a fairly good balance in public finances.
Returning to France in 1748, he was first, until 1763, steward of the port of Brest and, as such, he remained in contact with the colony by helping several Acadians deported to establishing themselves in France and ensuring the fitting out of ships bound for Quebec (city) during the Seven Years' War.
Gilles Hocquart was appointed State Councilor in 1764 and, until his death, he was entrusted with the stewardship of the Navy classes.
One of his main achievements was the construction of a depot at the Intendant's palace in Quebec (city), where all of the colony's timed registers and documents are stored.
Despite the refusal of the king of France, Gilles Hocquart arranged for this place to keep the official documents of the colony in a safe place.
Several historians of French Canada emphasize that his stubbornness in front of the king would have made it possible to preserve a substantial part of the archives written in the XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries.
The toponym "Lac Hocquart" was formalized on December 5, 1968 by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

A Rubber Band Christmas
A Rubber Band Christmas is a 1996 instrumental Christmas novelty album featuring traditional and popular Christmas songs played entirely on rubber bands, staplers and other office equipment.
The album is noted for its comic effects and has been described as one of the "weirdest" and most novel releases of its type.
The album came about when two artists, Jeff St. Pierre and Philip Antoniades, found themselves bored one evening at the office and began creating Christmas music out of rubber bands, staplers, tape and other office supplies to hand.
After entertaining themselves through the night with this diversion, they forwarded the results as a "seasonal thank you" to friends and associates.
The recording was sufficiently well received that Artist Development Associates of Framingham, Massachusetts, decided to release it as a CD, under the title "A Rubber Band Christmas", with St. Pierre and Antoniades going by the name "The Rubberband Band".
The CD was re-released on October 24, 2000.
The album's fourteen tracks typically feature a rubber band twanging out the melody, while a ruler struck at different lengths adds a bass accompaniment.
Rhythm is sometimes supplied through the use of "quickly-yanked frosty tape".
The tracks featured are a selection of traditional and popular Christmas carols and ballads, with the word "rubber" substituted at some point in the title, yielding names such as "Rubber Bells" (for Jingle Bells), "Rudolph the Rubber-nosed Reindeer" (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer) and "Feliz Rubberdad" (Feliz Navidad) etc.
"AllMusic" states that in spite of the unusual instrumentation, the tracks are "still recognizable as—and a whole lot sillier than—the original carols."
The reviewer concludes that while the 14 tracks "may be too much of a good thing", the release constitutes "easily the most novel holiday novelty album in a long while.
It must be heard to be believed."
Scott Frampton of "CMJ New Music Monthly" wrote that the album would have strong appeal to "aficionados of the pop-culturally weird".
Kyle Brown of "Rubber and Plastic News" wrote that "The snaps and twangs aren't always pitch-perfect, but a lot of spirit comes through.
Even the off notes sometimes sound catchy in new and interesting ways."
Canadian broadcaster and columnist MC Gilles included the album at number three in a list of his five top Christmas novelty albums, describing it as "unbearable, but nice."
Brian Boyd of the "Irish Times" included the album at number four on a list of "5 weirdest albums of all time", describing it as "a unique listening experience ...
Criminally out of print, it can only be listened to in [short] intervals" but "you sort of want it in your collection all the same."
Tracks from the album have been featured on both the BBC and on the ABC's Radio National websites, the latter in a "Christmas surprise cracker."

Final
Timeline of the Syrian Civil War (September–December 2019)
The following is a timeline of the Syrian Civil War from September–December 2019.
Information about aggregated casualty counts is found at Casualties of the Syrian Civil War.
In October 2019, Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring amid a U.S. withdrawal.
In response to the Turkish offensive, Russia arranged for negotiations between the Syrian government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led forces.
Russia also negotiated a renewal of a cease-fire between Kurds and Turkey that was about to expire.
The US withdrawal caused major policy debate amongst US officials.
Some officials asserted that they had advised the Kurds for some time to reach some understanding with Turkey.
“We did not give a military guarantee to the Kurds against Turkey...” said James Jeffrey at a hearing on Oct. 22.
“In fact, much of our conversations with the Kurds [was] that you had to find some kind of political accommodation with Turkey because you couldn’t count on us to keep the Turks out militarily.”
Amid the Turkish offensive and U.S. withdrawal, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander-in-chief Mazloum Abdi announced that they were ready to partner with Russia and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian government, stating that "... if we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people."
According to Syrian Kurdish officials, the deal allowed Syrian government forces to take over security in some border areas, but their own administration would maintain control of local institutions.
Syrian troops entered some key towns in northeastern Syria, including Manbij, Tell Tamer, Kobanî, and Ayn Issa, and took up position in some areas to oppose Turkish troops that were threatening various Kurdish forces.
The developments led to Kurdish concern that the independence of their declared Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES) in Rojava might be severely curtailed.
On 15 October, Russian forces began patrolling along the contact line between Turkish and Syrian government forces in northeast Syria, filling the security vacuum created by the sudden U.S. withdrawal.
Video footage showed Russian soldiers and journalists touring a base that the U.S. left behind.
Alexander Lavrentiev, Russia's special envoy on Syria, warned that the Turkish offensive into Syria was unacceptable and stated that Russia was seeking to prevent conflict between Turkish and Syrian troops.
Russia and Turkey made an agreement via the Sochi Agreement of 2019 to set up a Second Northern Syria Buffer Zone.
Syrian President Assad expressed full support for the deal, as various terms of the agreement also applied to the Syrian government.
Following the creation of the Second Northern Syria Buffer Zone the SDF stated that it was ready to merge with the Syrian Army if when a political settlement between the Syrian government and the SDF is achieved.
The Syrian Democratic Council said it was ready to have positive discussions with the Assad government.
They said their focus would shift to stopping the Turkish invasion.
On 30 October, the recently-negotiated Syrian Constitutional Committee held its inaugural meeting.
In November 2019, refugees in Northeast Syria reported they had received no help from international aid organizations.
On 20 November 2019, a new Syrian Constitutional Committee, with about 150 members, began discussing a new settlement and to draft a new constitution for Syria.
The committee includes representatives of the Syrian government, opposition groups, and countries serving as guarantors of the process such as Russia.
However, this committee has faced strong opposition from the Syrian government.
50 of the committee members represent the Assad government, and 50 members represent the opposition.
The committee began working in November 2019 in Geneva, under UN auspices.
However, the Syrian government delegation left on the second day of the process.
On 24 November, pro-government forces launched a new Idlib offensive, the largest offensive by the Syrian government in Idlib in more than three months.
Russia and Syria escalated their attacks against rebel forces in Idlib.
This was criticized by the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning against violence against civilians in Idlib.
A new international issue emerged when Syrian forces reached the area of various Turkish outposts, and Erdogan said that Turkish forces would not withdraw from any position.
Syrian troops closed in on the town of Maaret al-Numan.
On December 30, 2019, the US launched air strikes in Syria against rebel groups allied with Iran.
It appeared that Turkey was withdrawing all of its forces away from the al-Shirkark silos, which hold important supplies of wheat, this seemed to be a result of Russian mediation.
However, some reports said they later returned to re-occupy that area.
Russia said it would pledge to remove Turkish forces from a key highway in northern Syria, and replace them with Russian forces to maintain stability.
Russian and Turkish forces are continuing their joint patrols.
Questions remained about how much control Turkey has over its proxies, such as the Free Syrian Army.
Turkey has begun to appoint local mayors and governors in several northern Syrian towns.
They have also appointed about 4,000 police officers and other local officials, and are providing some basic local services for citizens.
There are some reports that Turkey has become more involved with local infrastructure in areas that it controls.
Some local schools have been provided with some teachers and curriculum components.
Erdogan said that Turkey expects to resettle about 1 million refugees in that a rea, and called for more support from the EU and from world organizations.
Some protesters in Syria blamed Turkey for the latest Syrian attacks on Idlib.
They claim that the rebel groups posted near Idlib are largely akin to mercenary groups answering to Turkey.
It is unclear whether there is strong evidence for this allegation.
Meanwhile, as Turkey considers sending some elements of these groups to Libya, it heightens such allegations.
A major statement from NGO ACT Alliance found that millions of Syrian refugees remain displaced in countries around Syria.
this includes around 1.5 million refugees in Lebanon.
Also the report found that refugees in camps in north-eastern Syria have tripled this year.
The UNHCR has also been tracking data on refugees, and maintains an official website to do so.
Numerous refugees remain in local refugee camps.
Conditions there are reported to be severe, especially with winter approaching.
4,000 people are housed at the Washokani Camp.
No organizations are assisting them other than the Kurdish Red Cross.
Numerous camp residents have called for assistance from international groups.
Over 120,000 refugees were reported fleeing Idlib governorate.
In December 2019, Erdogan stated that Syrian bombing of Idlib had caused new waves of refugees to enter Turkey,also stated that Turkey could not handle this new influx, and that this influx would be "be "felt by all European countries".
The UN said 235,0000 refugees have fled the area.
Turkey is reaching out to Russia to try to mitigate the situation.
Erdogan said he would ask for Russia's help in limiting the new wave of refugees.
The Syrian Army is continuing to attack, with Russian air support.
Erdogan said that Turkey expects to resettle about 1 million refugees in the "buffer zone" that it controls.
Erdogan claimed that Turkey had spent billions on approximately five million refugees now being housed in Turkey; and called for more funding from wealthier nations and from the EU.
This plan raised concerns among Kurds about displacement of existing communities and groups in that area.
SDF Commander Mazlum Abdi called on the US and Russia to help stop Turkey from displacing entire communities and ethnic groups from the areas that it controls.
Erdogan stated that Turkey was ready to resettle the Syrian refugees in the northern area that Turkey had invaded, and that Turkey would pay for it if necessary.
On 9 December 2019, various local accounts indicated that Turkey was moving Syrian refugees into its zone of operations in Northern Syria for the first time.
Erdogan said that Turkey was working to settle one million people in the cities of Tal Abyad and Ras Al-Ain in northern Syria.
This has led to fears of population change Erdogan claimed that Turkey had spent billions on approximately five million refugees now being housed in Turkey; and also asserted that wealthier nations had done little to address the situation.
This issue caused discussion in Turkish society.
In December 2019, Erdogan stated that Syrian bombing of Idlib had caused new waves of refugees to enter Turkey.
Erdogan stated that Turkey could not handle this new influx, and that this influx would be "be "felt by all European countries".
On December 30, 2019, over 50 Syrian refugees, including 27 children, were welcomed in Ireland, where they started afresh in their new temporary homes at the Mosney Accommodation Centre in Co Meath.
The migrant refugees were pre-interviewed by Irish officials under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).
As of December 2019, a diplomatic dispute is occurring at the UN over re-authorization of cross-border aid for refugees.
China and Russia oppose the draft resolution that seeks to re-authorize crossing points in Turkey, Iraq, and Jordan; China and Russia, as allies of Assad, seek to close the two crossing points in Iraq and Jordan, and to leave only the two crossing points in Turkey active.
All of the ten individuals representing the non-permanent members of the Security Council stood in the corridor outside of the chamber speaking to the press to state that all four crossing points are crucial and must be renewed.
United Nations official Mark Lowcock is asking the UN to re-authorize cross-border aid to enable aid to continue to reach refugees in Syria.
He says there is no other way to deliver the aid that is needed.
He noted that four million refugees out of the over eleven million refugees who need assistance are being reached through four specific international crossing points.
Lowcock serves as the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.<ref name="UN VOA 12/2019">Margaret Besheer (18 December 2019), "UN: Ability to Get Lifesaving Aid to 4 Million Syrians at Risk".</ref>
Russia, aided by China's support, has vetoed the resolution to retain all four border crossings.
An alternate resolution also did not pass.
The US strongly criticized the vetoes and opposition by Russia and China.
The US Ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, said this opposition to these crossings would be "disastrous."
An official statement by the US Government on the State Department website stated this veto was "shameful."
Erdogan said that Turkey expects to resettle about 1 million refugees in the "buffer zone" that it controls.
Erdogan claimed that Turkey had spent billions on approximately five million refugees now being housed in Turkey; and called for more funding from wealthier nations and from the EU.
This plan raised concerns among Kurds about displacement of existing communities and groups in that area.
Russia is taking a leading role in assisting with efforts to rebuild infrastructure in Syria.
In addition to efforts by the Russian government, several Russian companies have begun to take leading roles in economic rebuilding projects as well.
In general positive negotiations have increased between Syria and Turkey, and between Syria and Kurdish groups.
On the ground, Turkish areas of operations had been delineated by Russian mediators.
Russian military officials forged agreements between Syria, Turkey and Kurds for areas to be patrolled by each side.
Russia handles security through its own forces deployed in some key towns.
On 9 December, Russian troops entered Raqqa and began distributing humanitarian aid.
As a result of the Turkish incursion, multiple Kurdish groups that were once rivals have begun to seek greater unity.
Additionally, Syrian Kurdish officials have had some positive discussions with the Assad government, and with local countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE and Jordan.
Various Kurdish faction that were historical rivals began to meet in order to work together more.
Their stated reason was to stand together against Russia and Turkey more strongly if needed.
The Russian government has informed the Kurdish factions that they should reconcile and come up with a unified set of demands to clarify to Russia.
Various Kurdish factions blamed each other and their council for lack of progress.
The national Syrian government sent representatives to northeast Syria to meet with local groups there in order to address their concerns and to emphasize unity and combined effort to address problems.
A meeting occurred in Qamishli city, in northeast Syria, that included Syrian national officials, and delegates from Kurdish, Arab, and Syrian figures and forces.
Kurdish delegates emphasized their desire to help to protect Syria as a whole.
They expressed willingness to have positive discussions with the Assad government.
Some reports indicated that meetings between officials of the Assad government and leaders of local political factions went well, and all parties agreed on common goals to improve Syrian society as a whole.
The SDF has shown some reluctance to integrate into the Syrian National Army as requested by the Assad government, though.
Luqman Ehmê, spokesman for the North East Syria Autonomous Administration, said that his organization was ready for positive discussions with the Syrian regime.
SDF General Commander Mazlum Abdi has met with local leaders of the Wise Committee, which is composed of leaders of local communities and local family groupings.
This meeting emphasized the importance on national unity, and the need to stand against Turkish invaders.
The M4 road to Aleppo was set to reopen, based on an agreement mediated by Russia with Turkey, Turkey's allies in Syria, and the SDF.
It was reported that the Russian and Turkish armies had made a deal whereby electricity would be supplied to Tal Abyad by Russia's allies, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who now support Assad; while water would be supplied by the Alouk water station that is controlled by Turkish forces.
This deal was mainly facilitated by Russian military officials.
On 12 December 2019, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that Turkey's northern buffer zone had now "stabilized" the situation in northern Syria.
At a panel discussion on the conflict in December 2019, several experts said the conflict was slowly moving towards resolution.
One expert said that the "Astana" diplomatic process, involving Turkey, Russia, and Iran, was having some positive results.
Experts also said that Bashar Assad had made progress in restoring rule by local councils in areas affected by the conflict.
In December 2019, the EU held an international conference which condemned any suppression of the Kurds, and called for the self-declared Automnomous Administration in Rojava to be preserved and to be reflected in any new Syrian Constitution.
The Kurds are concerned that the independence of their declared Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES) in Rojava might be severely curtailed.
The United States announced it will pass major new sanctions against Syria and Russia, as well as Iran, reportedly due to alleged war crimes committed during the civil war.
The US Congress has enacted punitive sanctions on the Syrian government for its actions during the Civil War.
These sanctions would penalize any entities lending support to the Syrian government, and any companies operating in Syria.
US President Donald Trump tried to protect the Turkish President Erdogan from the effect of such sanctions.
Some activists welcomed this legislation.
Some critics noted that these punitive sanctions are likely to backfire or have unintended consequences; i.e., instead of impeding or curtailing the Syrian government, it will increase its authority, as ordinary Syrian people will now have less economic resources due to these sanctions, and will need to rely on the Syrian government and its economic allies and projects even more.
Critics said that such economic sanctions have little realistic chance of promoting real reform and democracy; their impact on the political ruling class will be limited, while they will likely affect ordinary Syrians disproportionately.
Mohammed al-Abdallah, Executive Director of Syria Justice and Accountability Center (SJAC), said that the sanctions will likely hurt ordinary Syrian people, saying, “it is an almost unsolvable unfeasible equation.
If they are imposed, they will indirectly harm the Syrian people, and if they are lifted, they will indirectly revive the Syrian regime;” he attributed the sanctions to “political considerations, as the United States does not have weapons and tools in the Syrian file, and sanctions are its only means.”
Peter Ford, the former UK Ambassador to Syria, said "...going forward, we’re seeing more economic warfare.
It seems that the US, having failed to change the regime in Syria by military force or by proxies, is tightening the economic screws and the main reason why the US is keeping hold of the production facilities in eastern Syria.
So, the economic situation is becoming more and more serious and dire in Syria and it’s a major reason why refugees are not going back.”
In the Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration in Northern and Eastern Syrian (NES) of Rojava, Kurdish opposition parties have refused to re-open their offices.
they have cited a lack of trust in the regional government of Rojava.
Meanwhile, officials of the NES held meetings with local Arab leaders, who stated that Kurdish forces are unfairly detaining women and children from their communities.
At the NATO summit in London in December 2019, President Emmanuel Macron of France highlighted major differences with Turkey over the definition of terrorism, and said there was little chance this aspect of the conflict could be resolved positively.
Macron criticized Turkey strongly for fighting against groups who had been allied with France and the West in fighting terrorism.
Numerous issues in resolving the conflict emerged at the NATO summit in London.
Turkey proposed a safe zone where Syrian refugees could be relocated, but this idea did not receive support from all parties.
Prior to the NATO Summit, there was a meeting at 10 Downing Street of the leaders of France, the UK, Germany and Turkey.
One key point that emerged that the Western countries insisted that refugees could only be relocated voluntarily.
Meanwhile, there were concerns in NATO about Turkey's growing closeness with Russia.
Erdogan claimed that a four-way summit on Syria was scheduled to occur in Turkey in February 2020, to include Turkey, Germany, the UK and France.
At a meeting in Damascus, Russian and Syrian officials clearly stated their support for Syria regaining control over all of its territory.
The United Arab Emirates also expressed official support for Assad.
A new round of meetings for the Astana summit process took place in the Kazakh capital Nur Sultan.
The meeting includes Russia, Syria, Turkey and Iran.
At this meeting Russia, stated that the "safe zone" established by Turkey should not be expanded, as this would not accomplish anything positive for the region.
The Astana process was created by Turkey, Iran and Russia in order to find a lasting solution to the conflict.
they have examined a process to reform the constitution of Syria via the newly-formed Syrian Constitutional Committee.
The parties reported that they reached some important understandings at this meeting, including affirming a commitment to work together to respect Syrian territorial integrity.
The United States has boycotted this process.
At the Astana Process meeting in December 2019, a UN official stated that in order for the third round of talks to proceed, co-chairs from the Assad regime and the opposition need to agree on an agenda.
The committee has two co-chairs, Ahmad Kuzbari representing the Assad regime, and Hadi Albahra from the opposition.
It is unclear if the third round of talks will proceed on a firm schedule, until the Assad regime provides its assent to participate.
The Arab League has offered to allow Syria to rejoin as a member.
They have stipulated two pre-conditions for doing so; firstly, that Syria distance itself from Iran, and, secondly that Syria implement UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for the a process to reform the Syrian Constitution, and then to hold an election to end the Syrian conflict.

Apica River
The Apica River is a freshwater tributary of the Pikauba River, flowing in the unorganized territory of Lac-Ministuk, in the Le Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
The Apica River flows through a narrow, steep valley.
Visitors can admire the panorama from a rest area located a few kilometers north of the route 169 bridge over it.
This river turns out to be the outlet of a series of small aligned lakes, located to the south, Lake Micoine constituting its head.
At the end of the route, the Apica river flows at the foot of Apica mountain, culminating at .
The lake of the same name is located to the southwest of Mount-Apica; however, this lake is integrated into the watershed of the rivière aux Écorces.
The upper part of the Apica valley is accessible by the route 169 (route d'Iberville); other secondary forest roads have been developed in the sector for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
Forestry is the primary economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second.
The surface of the Apica River is usually frozen from late November to early April, however safe circulation on the ice is generally from mid-December to late March.
The Apica River intersects the route 169 connecting Quebec (city) to Lac Saint-Jean, halfway between Jacques-Cartier Lake and the northwest limit of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
The main watersheds adjacent to the Apica River are:
The Apica River rises at the mouth of Lake Micoine (altitude: ).
The mouth which is on the north shore of this head lake is located at:
From the mouth of Lake Micoine, the course of the Apica River flows over entirely in the forest zone, with a drop of , according to the following segments :
The Apica river flows on the west bank of the Pikauba River.
This confluence is located at:
From the confluence of the Apica river with the Pikauba River, the current descends successively the Pikauba river on to the northeast, then the current crosses the Kenogami Lake on north-east to Barrage de Portage-des-Roches, then follows the course of the Chicoutimi River on to the east, then the northeast, and the course of the Saguenay River on east to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.
The Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec (1914 and 1925) calls this stream "Upika River".
The toponymic designation of this river appears under the spelling "Upica" on the map of the province of Quebec by Eugène Taché (1870), in Studies by Stanislas Drapeau on the developments of the colonization of Lower Canada (1863), and in an 1850 report from the Commissioner of Crown Lands, JH Price, with the spelling "Upika".
The Innu term "upica" means "it is constricted" when speaking of a watercourse.
This term could also mean "carrying strap", according to an interpretation known formerly.
Long used, the name "Upica" was changed in 1961 to "Apica" as was the new designation "Mount Apica".
This mountain then acquired a certain notoriety following the installation, nearby, of a radar station, today disused.
The toponym "Apica river" was formalized on June 6, 1973 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church
St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church in Wake Forest, North Carolina, a suburb of Raleigh.
The first Catholics to settle in Wake Forest were George Bolus and his wife in 1910.
Soon after, the Wilkinson family moved to the area from New Orleans, becoming the second Catholic family in the town.
Catholics who soon after settled in the town had to travel to Raleigh to attend mass.
As more Catholics settled in the area, a traveling priest John A. Beshel, the Chaplain of the Nazareth Orphanage, occasionally celebrated mass in the living room of the home of the Bolus family, using a closet as a confessional.
In 1938 St. Peter's Chapel, a Railroad chapel car built by the Catholic Extension Society of Chicago in 1892, was given to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh to use as a house of worship for Catholics in Wake Forest.
The train car, which included a bedroom and kitchen for the priest, an altar, and sixty seats for congregants, was parked at the Seaboard Railroad by Bishop Eugene J. McGuinness, and was used until February of 1940.
In the 1930s Biship McGuinness' cousin, the papal countess Katherine E. Price, visited Wake Forest and was surprised that the college town did not have a Catholic Church.
She donated a large amount of money for the construction of a church and rectory.
A plot of land was purchased at 701 South Main Street and construction began in 1939.
The architect for the original church was Frank Frimmer of Tampa, Florida.
The Gothic church was built using granite from the nearby town of Rolesville.
The church was dedicated by Bishop McGuinness on February 25, 1940 and named after Catherine of Siena, the patron saint of Price.
In 1947 Father Tevlin, the priest at St. Catherine's, built St. Eugene's Church in Wendell as a daughter parish.
In 1948 John Hyland succeeded Tevlin as priest of St. Catherine's and St. Eugene's.
Hyland, who was the first superior of Bishop Vincent Stanislaus Waters' Missionary Apostolate.
He made Wake Forest the headquarters of the Missionary Fathers from a mobile trailer-chapel called Madonna of the Highways, located near St. Catherine's.
The trailer was dedicated on May 6, 1948 by the Apostolic Delegate Amleto Giovanni Cicognani at the annual convention of the North Carolina Catholic Laymen Association in Wilmington.
On August 14, 1966 a transport tractor trailer struck a power pole and trees along the front side of the church.
A large marble statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was knocked into the church, destroying part of the south wall, foundation, and interior of part of the church.
On September 4, 1977, the parish rectory caught on fire.
On August 27, 1979 lightning struck the church bell tower, severely damaging it.
In May 1987 the pastoral administrative duties were granted to Sister Joanne DiGiovanni of the Sisters of Mercy until a new priest was hired in July of that year.
In 1988 the church purchased 18.625 acres of land near West Holding Avenue for $172,212.50 in order to build a larger facility.
In 1997, new buildings were built on the plot on West Holding, including a parochial school.
In 1999 St. Catherine's founded its second daughter parish, Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church in Louisburg.
In 2001 St. Catherine's purchased over 20 acres of land west of new property for $800,000, building a new school buildings.
In 2009 the church hired the architect Jim O’Brien and Clancy & Theys construction company to build a 33,000 square foot church in the Romanesque style, with seating for 1,700 people.
The new church cost $9 million to build.

The 18 teams will play each other twice (once at home and once away) for a total of 34 matches.
Qualification for the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana will be awarded to the top seven teams at the end of the season, as well as the Copa Chile champions who will qualify for the Copa Libertadores.
Since there were no relegated teams in the previous season, in this season three teams will be relegated to the second tier: the last-placed team in the standings of the 2020 season, the last-placed team in a relegation table which will be elaborated considering the performance in both the 2019 and 2020 seasons, and the losers of a play-off between the teams placed second-to-last of both tables.
Eighteen teams will take part in the league in this season: the sixteen teams from the previous season, plus the 2019 Primera B champions Santiago Wanderers and Deportes La Serena, winners of the Primera B promotion play-offs.
For this season, a weighted table will be elaborated by computing an average of the points earned per game over this season and the previous one, with the average of points earned in the 2019 season weighted by 60% and the average of points earned in the 2020 season weighted by 40%.
Promoted teams will only have their points in the 2020 season averaged, without weighting.
The team placed last in this table at the end of the season will be relegated, while the team placed second-to-last will qualify for the relegation play-off.

Yummy (Justin Bieber song)
"Yummy" is a song by Canadian singer Justin Bieber.
It was released on January 3, 2020, along with a lyric video through Def Jam Recordings as the lead single from his upcoming fifth studio album, "Changes".
The song is Bieber's first solo single to be released in three years.
Bieber notably joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok on the day of the song's release.
The song received mixed reviews from music critics, with some praising the song's R&B sound, but dismissing the lyrics.
Bieber received criticism for the song's "excessive promotion".
The song debuted at number two on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, while reaching the top five in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and various other countries; and hitting number one only in New Zealand.
The song's official music video was released on January 4, 2020.
On December 23, 2019, Bieber teased the release by posting a picture of himself in front of a piano accompanied by two posts with the caption "tomorrow".
On the following day, he announced the single via a trailer he uploaded to YouTube that shows him walking through an abandoned gas station.
The trailer also serves as an announcement for his upcoming North American tour starting May 14, 2020, as well as a documentary covering "all different stories".
About the upcoming music, Bieber stated that he feels like "this is different than the previous albums just because of where I'm at in my life".
On the release day of "Yummy", Bieber joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok and posted a video of himself lip-syncing to the song, and encouraged his fans to do so, as well.
Four days later, Bieber released autographed limited editions of "Yummy", including a cassette, a seven-inch picture disc, six unique CDs and five unique seven-inch vinyl discs, available for only 24 hours.
Bieber released five additional music videos for the song, titled: "Animated Version", "x drew house, Animated Version", "Beliebers React", "Fan Lip Sync" and "Food Fight", and launched an official "Yummy" online game.
"Yummy" is a "straightforward R&B number" that moves along on pop-trap beats.
The song contains a "crisp bass line and plinking keyboards".
Bieber rap-sings the pre-chorus, while he hits his "signature falsetto" in the bridge.
Bryan Rolli of "Forbes" magazine called the chorus "seductive", albeit "meaningless".
The song is considered an ode to Bieber's wife, Hailey Bieber.
In an exclusive interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Bieber admitted that Yummy is about his sex life.
The song received mixed reviews from music critics.
Rania Aniftos of "Billboard" magazine said "Yummy" brings back "the flirtatious Bieber we've missed and been waiting for", describing the chorus as "catchy".
Bryan Rolli, writing for "Forbes", said that Bieber "sings his heart out" on the song and noted although "the lyrics may not invite scholarly analysis ... Bieber sure does sound good singing them".
Rolli concluded calling the song a "win, an inevitable chart smash" and opined that it is "sure to sound even better when 50,000 fans scream it every night on his upcoming tour".
Mikael Wood of "Los Angeles Times" described the song as "a lithe little R&B number that faintly recalls Ginuwine's mid-'90s classic 'Pony' and basically three-and-a-half minutes of PG-13 sex talk seemingly directed at Hailey Baldwin".
He stated that "though it's very cute, 'Yummy' feels awfully lightweight for a single that has as much hanging on it as this one does" and added that the song "loses much of its flavor after only a few spins".
Brad Callas of "Complex" magazine listed "Yummy" amongst the best new music of the week and said Bieber's "pivot back to R&B is refreshing for those who were fans of his slept-on 2013 project, "Journals"".
Callas further remarked that the "silky vocals" is at times reminiscent of Bieber's 2016 collaboration with Post Malone, "Deja Vu".
"NME"s Sam Moore complimented the song's R&B production, but dismissed the lyrics, which he termed as "failed expectations".
He opined that the song's producers opted for "minimalism with their choice of instrumentation, melding airy keys with pop-trap beats with an evident view of creating something as universal as the likes of 'Hotline Bling' and Childish Gambino's 'Feels Like Summer'".
Moore further wrote that Bieber's layered vocals and harmonies are "able to glide along rather effortlessly—it's just a shame he doesn't have more to say with them" and that Bieber's embrace of R&B "isn't a complete turn-off".
"Pitchfork"s Eric Torres criticized the song for being "shamelessly engineered for the truncated attention span of TikTok" and "a bloodless shell of an R&B song crippled by asinine lyrics and a tired, syncopated backdrop".
He further wrote that the song "plateaus as soon as it starts, never inching past the toddler-like repetition of 'yummy-yum' in its chorus".
The Guardian's Alexis Petridis wrote that "Yummy" is "eager to go viral" on TikTok, comparing it to viral songs on the lip-syncing app such as Arizona Zervas's "Roxanne", Ashnikko's "Stupid" and Regard's "Ride It", and that "a generation grown on highly sophisticated, multilayered internet culture can detect bullshit a mile off: this is so nakedly eager to go viral that it almost certainly won't."
Petridis pointed out the "shameless plug for his streetwear brand Drew House", "the cringeworthy use of trap ebonics", "use of baby talk to vaguely gesture at a world of sexual pleasure" and the "chorus seems designed purely for Gen Z-ers in yoga pants to spoon frozen acai into their mouths while miming along to the word 'yummy'".
He concluded by stating Bieber "doesn't need the TikTok virality, but craves its pop-cultural relevance – and that desperation chafes awkwardly against the spiritually grounded marital bliss of his current image".
The music video for "Yummy" was directed by Bardia Zeinali and premiered on January 4, 2020.
In the video, it portrays Bieber with pink hair at a dinner party in a fancy restaurant, eating various colorful food items with the guests.
The video garnered 8.4 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming his second biggest 24-hour debut on the platform out of his 5 lead singles.
In the United States, "Yummy" debuted at number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, blocked from the top spot by Roddy Ricch's "The Box", becoming Bieber's second consecutive single as a lead artist to debut at the second spot, following "I Don't Care", which was blocked from the top set by "Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus.. "Yummy" proceeded to fall to number ten the following week.
On the UK Singles Chart, the track debuted at number five, becoming his first lead single to not debut in the top 3 of the chart since "One Time" the lead single from his debut EP, My World.
"Yummy" also debuted in the top 10 in Ireland, where it landed at number 8, as well as number 16 in Scotland.
It also debuted in the top 20 of other European countries, going number 7 in the Netherlands, number 10 in Italy and number 15 in Germany.
In Oceania, the song debuted at number 8 in Australia, peaking at number 4.
In New Zealand, it topped the singles chart in its second week.
Bieber received criticism for his "excessive" promotion of "Yummy" during the song's release week, that included release of autographed CD variants, seven different videos for the song, launching an official "Yummy" game, online fan interactions that involved Bieber asking fans to buy the song and Bieber's manager Scooter Braun encouraging fans to mass-purchase the song.
Bieber received backlash for manipulation of streaming services, with many calling it "desperate" and "privileged" attempts at making the song debut at number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, after predictions of Roddy Ricch's "The Box" rising to the top spot.
During an Instagram live session, Bieber asked his fans to stream and buy "Yummy" on iTunes, and reposted instructions from a fan titled "How to Get 'Yummy' to #1", detailing how to help the song hit number one on the chart.
Those instructions included buying the song multiple times on Bieber's website and iTunes, creating a Spotify playlist consisting only of "Yummy" and streaming it on repeat at low volume, and having fans outside the US download a VPN app, and set it to the US to inflate Bieber's US streams that contribute to the chart.
However, "Yummy" debuted only at number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, blocked from the number-one spot as "The Box" rose to the top spot.

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript adaptation (SICP JS) is an adaptation of the computer science textbook "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP).
It teaches fundamental principles of computer programming, including recursion, abstraction, modularity, and programming language design and implementation.
While the original version of SICP uses the programming language Scheme, this adaptation uses the programming language JavaScript.
The National University of Singapore published draft editions online since 2012, and a first public release on December 13 2019.
As of 2019, the book is continuously updated and improved by the community of its readers.
It has been used in NUS's introductory course in computer science.
As its original, SICP JS focuses on discovering general patterns for solving specific problems, and building software systems that make use of those patterns.
The book describes computer science concepts using Source, a series of sublanguages of JavaScript.
It also uses a virtual register machine and assembler to implement JavaScript interpreters and compilers.
The book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 License.
SICP JS has been used in the course CS1101S at the National University of Singapore (NUS) since 2012.
While the book focuses on principles, models and abstractions for programming rather than specific programming languages, all examples in the original version are written in the programming language Scheme.
SICP JS uses the language JavaScript instead of Scheme.
Since JavaScript shares its functional core with Scheme, the adaptation is straightforward and literal in most places.
Scheme's homoiconicity is replaced by references to an explicit parser in Chapters 4 and 5.
Source is a series of sublanguages of JavaScript, originally inspired by , Douglas Crockford.
It comprises the languages Source §1, Source §2, Source §3 and Source §4, corresponding to the respective chapters of SICP JS.
Each language is a sublanguage of the next, and designed to contain only features needed by the respective chapter.
These languages are implemented by the Source Academy, a web-based programming environment that features various tools to support the reader of SICP JS.

Royal Irish Regiment of Foot Guards
The Royal Irish Regiment of Foot Guards, or "His Majesty’s Regiment of Guards in Ireland", was a regiment of foot guards first raised in 1662 for service in Ireland.
Part of the Royal Irish Army of Charles II, it was initially garrisoned around Dublin.
During the 1688 Glorious Revolution the Foot Guards under their commanding officer William Dorrington stayed loyal to James II, and fought on the Jacobite side in the Williamite War in Ireland.
After the 1697 Peace of Ryswick and the formal disestablishment of James’s army in exile, the Foot Guards were immediately reconstituted in French service as Dorrington’s Regiment, retaining their red coats and Saint George's Cross standard.
As part of the Irish Brigade they distinguished themselves in a number of campaigns.
Renamed the Regiment Roth after a subsequent colonel, Michael Roth, and later still as the Regiment Walsh, the regiment did not formally disband until 1791.
Charles II issued the order for the regiment's creation in April 1662, soon after the Restoration.
The remainder of the 7,500-strong army formed in Ireland at this point was not formally regimented until the 1670s, and contained many Cromwellian veterans.
Leading Royalist James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond was given the commission to raise the regiment and authority to appoint junior officers; the experienced Anglo-Irish soldier Sir William Flower was made lieutenant-colonel, while Ormonde’s son Richard Butler, 1st Earl of Arran was gazetted colonel, with captaincy of a company.
Other commissions were given to members of Ormonde's circle such as Sir Nicholas Armorer and Sir John Stephens of Finglas.
The regiment was initially established at 1200 men in 12 companies, plus officers; it also included a chaplain, surgeon, drum-major and 24 drummers along with a piper to the "King's Company".
Many of the rank and file were raised in England, apparently to minimise Cromwellian influence, with further recruits from the ranks of the Irish “Independent Companies”.
Up until 1688 members of the Guards were quartered either in Dublin Castle or in the city gatehouses.
Under Arran, the Guards were employed largely on peacetime duties in Ireland: they were used to suppress a mutiny by other regiments in Carrickfergus in 1666, while in 1673 two companies were ordered to Chester and saw service on board ship during the Third Anglo-Dutch War.
Nevertheless the regiment retained a high prestige: a Major Billingsley recorded that "to be a Major of the Royal Regiment of Guards is better and more honourable than to be a Lieutenant-Colonel of any other regiment", while the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Clarendon, wrote approvingly of their appearance on parade.
For the first twenty years of its history the regiment was almost exclusively Protestant, with most of its officers drawn from the Irish Protestant gentry.
However the 1685 accession of Charles’s Catholic brother James accelerated the recruitment of Catholics, particularly as officers.
James’s associate Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell replaced a number of the rank and file, giving the pretext that “the King would have all his men young and of one size”; veteran lieutenant-colonel Sir Charles Feilding was replaced by William Dorrington, an English Catholic.
Dorrington continued reforming the regiment, though Clarendon criticised him for recruiting at the Catholic shrine St James's Well, feeling it would harm relations with the Catholic community.
Arran died in 1686 and his nephew James, Lord Ossory, later the 2nd Duke of Ormonde was briefly made colonel of the Guards: at the time of the Glorious Revolution, Ormonde switched his allegiance to William of Orange.
He was replaced as colonel by Dorrington and the majority of the regiment stayed loyal to James, although one of its two battalions, sent to England immediately prior to William's landing, was taken prisoner.
The Guards subsequently fought on the Jacobite side in the War in Ireland, including at the Siege of Derry, the Battle of the Boyne and at Aughrim, where their lieutenant-colonel William Mansfield Barker was killed.
Several hundred of their number were among those permitted to leave for France after the Jacobite defeat.
Following their departure, there would be no Irish Guards regiment until the formation of the Irish Guards in 1900.
In France the regiment continued to recruit from among Irish Jacobite exiles, the so-called “Wild Geese”, and saw further service in the Nine Years' War.
The terms of the Peace of Ryswick included the disbandment of James’s former army, but the same day as the Guards regiment was broken up, 27 February 1698, it was immediately reconstituted as Dorrington's Regiment in the French Army.
The regiment continued in French service in several campaigns.
It fought at Malplaquet, Dettingen and Fontenoy.
Dorrington ended his active service in c.1710 and died in 1718; Michael Roth, who had begun service with the Foot Guards as a lieutenant in 1686, became colonel, followed by his son Charles Edward, Comte de Roth, in 1733.
Elements of the regiment returned to Britain during the Jacobite Rising of 1745.
Between 1766 and 1770 the regiment’s colonel was the 9th Earl of Roscommon; its last colonel was Antoine Walsh, also known as the Comte de Walsh-Serrant.
In 1791, following the French Revolution, it was merged into the 92nd Regiment of the French Army.
The latter, today based in Clermont-Ferrand, is considered the last French regiment to descend directly from the regiments of the Irish Brigade.
Throughout most of its existence, even in French service, the regiment was issued with red coats with blue facings.
Its colours, a Saint George's Cross with a central crown surmounted with a crowned lion, reflected its original status as a Guards regiment of the King of England.

St Maurice's Church, Strasbourg
St Maurice's Church () is a Roman Catholic church building located on Place Arnold in the Neustadt district of Strasbourg, France.
It was built during the Annexation of Alsace-Lorraine into the German Empire in the late 19th century.
The construction works of the church started in November 1895 within the framework of the construction of the Neustadt district.
The church was designed by architect Ludwig Becker from Mainz, whose preliminary draft was selected during an architectural competition in 1893.
After several years of construction works, the church was consecrated on 28 May 1899.
It was originally the church of the Catholic garrison of the city.
On 21 February 2013, the church was vandalised by a man who damaged about fifteen statues and laid an Islamic prayer rug and a Qur'an which he had stolen in a mosque.
The man probably suffered from mental illness.
The Gothic Revival church was meant to be visible from far away, like the Protestant Church of St. Paul.
The tall and thin bell tower of St Maurice is 65 meters high and was placed in the several-kilometer-long perspective of Avenue des Vosges and Avenue de la Forêt-Noire which connect Place de Haguenau to Place Arnold.
A statue of Joan of Arc dated 1922 is located to the east of St Maurice's Church.
The statue used to stand at the entrance of the church but was moved after Place Arnold was renovated.
The main altar shows the life of St. Maurice, while the upper crucifix is surrounded by representations of St. Mary and St. John.
In the southern chapel, an altarpiece depicts the Virgin Mary.
The side chapel has a modern artwork made by Sylvie Lander.
All the windows of the church are filled with stained glass.
The organ of the church was made by in 1899.
It has 43 stops and 3 keyboards, as follows:

Maimi von Mirbach
Maimi von Mirbach, full name "Maria Celina Gabrielle Antoinette Freiin von Mirbach" (born April 9, 1899 in Antwerp; died October 8, 1984 in Berlin), was a German cellist and member of the Confessing Church.
Maimi von Mirbach came from an old noble family.
Her father, the merchant Wilhelm Freiherr von Mirbach (1858-1914) was a brother of the Prussian lieutenant general and court official Ernst von Mirbach (1844-1925).
Through her mother Carmen Laura, née von Bary (1876-1938), Maimi von Mirbach was directly related to Cornelio Saavedra, the first president of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata.
In this cosmopolitan and international parental home, she enjoyed a Christian-liberal education with a strong musical orientation.
In 1914, the family had to leave Belgium within 24 hours of the beginning of the First World War, moving to Potsdam.
Shaped by her experience as a member of a minority, Maimi von Mirbach turned early to people who needed help.
Already in the 1920s, she recognized the nationalistic and anti-Semitic development in Germany.
After the Nazi seizure of power, she helped persecuted Jews.
also following the values of the Confessing Church.
She abhorred the racial ideology of the Nazis and, as a cellist, continued to cultivate numerous contacts with Jewish musicians, even though this repeatedly put her in danger.
Maimi von Mirbach helped Fritz Hirschfeld, with whom she played in a private string quartet, escape in 1938.
Hirschfeld, chairman of the Potsdam Labor Court for six years from 1927, was arrested after Kristallnacht and remained in Potsdam police prison for three weeks.
He was only released on the condition that he would leave the country.
The German authorities demanded a Reich Flight Tax of 35,000 Reichsmark and a Jewish property tax of 38,000 Reichsmark.
To raise this sum, Maimi von Mirbach acquired the Hirschfelds' house and property.
His "Aryan" wife Grete stayed in the house free of charge until her death in April 1941.
Maimi von Mirbach gave Fritz Hirschfeld 8,000 Reichsmark in cash for his escape to Holland.
In August 1942, he was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and finally deported to Auschwitz, after which it is unknown what happened to him.
Maimi von Mirbach visited him several times in the internment camp and gave him food, jewelry, and money.
Von Mirbach hid Jews wanted by the Gestapo in her house several times in order to save them from deportation.
At the end of 1941 she accepted the former music student Gisela Distler-Brendel, a pupil of the composer and piano teacher Ilse Fromm-Michaels, as a lodger.
Gisela Distler-Brendel was a "first-degree half-breed" who was not allowed to study at a university.
She also had a forbidden relationship with a gentile, from whom she expected an illegitimate child.
Maimi von Mirbach kept this relationship secret from the authorities, and was thus guilty of racial disgrace under the Nuremberg Laws.
After 1945, Maimi von Mirbach was subjected to many humiliations and restrictions in the Soviet occupation zone and in the early days of the GDR.
In 1956, she left Potsdam and moved to Berlin-Charlottenburg.
Until her death, she told students about her experiences during the period of National Socialism in schools and youth institutions.
In 2005, the Potsdam Administrative Court dismissed an action brought by Maimi von Mirbach's heirs against the reassignment to Hirschfeld's daughter Aenne Dorothy Scott of the property in Klein Glienicke lawfully acquired by Fritz Hirschfeld and expropriated by the GDR.

For example, it is an effective reagent for the desulfurization of organic disulfides.
Carole Ann Haswell
Carole Ann Haswell is a British astrophysicist and current Professor of Astrophysics and Head of Astronomy at the Open University.
She is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.
She has been involved in the detection of several exoplanets, including Barnard's Star b.
Haswell was born in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, North Yorkshire, and grew up in Dormanstown.
Her father worked on an ammonia recovery plant at Imperial Chemical Industries.
She became interested in space as a child, when her father told her about the Apollo astronauts as they gazed at the moon while on Redcar beach.
Although she originally wanted to be an astronaut, she realised at the age of ten that this was impractical.
She attended Huntcliff School where she worked towards her GCE Ordinary Levels.
Whilst a student at Prior Pursglove and Stockton Sixth Form College, Haswell was interested in art, mathematics and physics, and was a fan of the television show "Star Trek".
One of her physics teachers was rumoured to be biased against girls, and despite Haswell achieving the highest grades possible in her A-level exams, refused to write her a reference to study physics at university.
She eventually studied mathematics at the University of Oxford, but wanted to apply mathematics to the real world and became tired of abstract proofs.
Haswell eventually spoke to Donald Blackwell who helped her transfer courses, and enrolled on a physics degree at University College, Oxford.
During her time as an undergraduate student, Haswell was President of the Oxford University Astronomical Society and rowed in the Summer Eights.
Haswell earned her doctorate at the University of Texas at Austin, where she worked on black hole binaries.
She attended the Hubble Space Telescope launch in 1990.
She later joined the Space Telescope Science Institute, where she worked on accretion flow and multi-wavelength observations.
In 1994, Haswell moved to Columbia University, where she worked on black hole X-ray transients and cataclysmic variable stars.
She was made a lecturer at the Barnard College where one of her students was Lauryn Hill.
Haswell moved back to the United Kingdom in 1996 and was made a lecturer at the University of Sussex.
Since 1999, she has been at the Open University, at first still working working on black holes and accreting binary stars and switching to exoplanet research in 2003.
Early work on exoplanets was not well funded, and Haswell has spoken about using second hand Canon camera lenses to make suitable telescopes.
First working on accreting binary stars, and then exoplanets.
In particular, Haswell studies short period exoplanets.
Since 2012 she has led the "Dispersed Matter Planet Project", which involves the analysis of light from nearby stars to identify which host mass-losing planets.
In 2018 Haswell was part of the team that was first to identify a planet around Barnard's Star, the closest single (non-binary) star to Earth, a red dwarf star that is six light years away from Earth.
Using the radial velocity method, the team discovered Barnard's Star b.
The solar system around Barnard's Star touches on the edge of the Oort cloud.
Barnard's Star b has a mass three times that of Earth and orbits Barnard's Star in 233 days.
Haswell has predicted that the planet may have a similar surface temperature to Europa.
In 2019 Haswell used the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) to discover six extraordinarily hot exoplanets (with surface temperatures between 1100 and 1800 °C).
At temperatures this high the atmosphere and surface levels of the planet can be lost, and the materials disperse into a thin sheet of gas.
The gas filters the light from nearby stars, which allowed Haswell and colleagues to study the chemical composition of the atmosphere of the gas sheet.
The planets have masses equivalent to 2.6 times the mass of the Earth with almost half the mass of Jupiter.
Haswell has proposed that these planets could be used to understand the geology of the rocky planets in Earth's solar system.
She is part of the team for CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS), which will examine known exoplanets to improve our understanding of their sizes.
CHEOPS, which features a 35 cm telescope, launched in December 2019.
Haswell has been featured in a Royal Astronomical Society exhibition on women fellows.
She regularly provides expert opinion to the national media and is involved with various outreach programmes through the International Astronomical Union.
Haswell was awarded the Open University Outreach and Public Engagement Award for her work targeted at people with low science capital in Teesside.
Haswell has a daughter.
She is interested in the stock market and has used her understanding of astrophysics to buy and sell stocks.
Haswell's publications include:
Oldknows Factory, Nottingham
The Oldknows Factory is a former lace factory on St Ann's Hill Road, in the city of Nottingham in England.
The factory is formed of two 18th century factories, which have since been joined.
The original purpose of both factories was the manufacture of lace.
It's since been converted to house artist studios, workshops, and offices to rent.
The original structure remains as a Grade II-listed building.
Lata Brandisová
Countess Marie Immaculata Brandisová, also known as Lata Brandisová or Lata von Brandis, (26 June 1895 – 12 May 1981) was a Czech equestrian and the only woman to win the Great Pardubice Steeplechase.
Her victory over the Nazi officers at the 1937 race, seen as a symbol of Czech resistance against Nazi Germany, was celebrated with parades attended by thousands of people.
She is the subject of Richard Askwith's book "Unbreakable: The Woman Who Defied The Nazis In The World’s Most Dangerous Horse Race".
Brandisová was born on 26 June 1895 at Schäffer Castle in Úmonín, Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic) to Count Leopold von Brandis and Johanna von Schäffer.
She was a member of an old Tyrolean family that had been ennobled in 1580, but later became impoverished.
Her father, a horse breeder, had served as a lieutenant colonel in the Austrian army.
Her mother was the daughter of Christian Ritter von Schäffer.
Her paternal grandmother, Countess Barbara Kinská, was the sister of Count Oktavian Kinsky, who was one of the founders of the Great Pardubice Steeplechase.
She had a twin sister, Countess Marie Kristýna Brandisová.
In 1897 they moved from Schäffer Castle to a chateau in Řitka owned by her mother.
Brandisová began horseback riding when she was eight years old and grew up attending horse races with her father.
In 1916, at the age of 21, she competed in her first horse race.
During the First World War, her father and brother, Count Nicholas von Brandis, went off to fight.
Her brother was killed in action in Italy.
Much of their property was seized y the government during the war.
After the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the family lost much of their remaining property.
She continued her training at the Prague-Velká Chuchle Racecourse and, in 1921, won her first women's race.
In 1926 her cousin Count Zdenko Radslav Kinský, a nephew of Oktavian, invited her to Orlík Castle to breed Kinsky horses for hurdle racing.
She continued to train as a horse racer at Velká Churchle and Veveří Castle under the coaching of Karel Šmejda.
In 1927 she signed up to race in the Great Pardubice Steeplechase.
Her enlistment in the race caused controversy, and she was faced with protests as the race was seen as too dangerous for a woman.
Petitions were made to the Czechoslovak Jockey Club to have Brandisová removed from the race.
The Jockey Club decided that she would be allowed to race, following advice from the Royal Jockey Club in Great Britain.
The Great Pardubice of 1927 was the first time a woman raced, and the first time a French rider raced (Count Alexandre de la Forest).
Brandisová placed fifth, after falling three times on the race track.
In 1933 she raced in the Great Pardubice on a mare named Norma and placed third.
A year later she placed second, and in 1935 she placed fifth.
In 1937 she raced with Norma in the 56th Great Pardubice.
At this time, there was extreme tension between Czechoslovakia and the neighboring Nazi Germany, with the Czechs fearing an invasion.
Over 40,000 people attended the race, hoping to see a Czech jockey defeat the Germans, who had been consecutive champions in the Great Pardubice over the last few years.
On 17 October 1937, Brandisová became the first woman to win the race, seven lengths ahead of a German rider.
Celebrations culminated with a 10,000 person parade from the racecourse to town square in Pardubice.
The race was not held again until after World War II.
Germany invaded Czechoslavkia in 1939, and Brandisová's estate was seized by the Nazi government.
During the war, she joined the Czech Resistance, providing food for resistance fighters and tending to wounded soldiers during the Liberation of Prague.
After the war, Brandisová raced again in the Grand Parduice, failing to finish in 1947.
After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1948, she and her sisters moved into cottage in the woods, where they lived in relative poverty throughout the Communist regime.
She died from pneumonia in Reiteregg, Austria on 12 May 1981.

John Mulaney &amp; the Sack Lunch Bunch
John Mulaney & the Sack Lunch Bunch is a children's musical comedy special created by John Mulaney that debuted on Netflix on December 24, 2019.
The show was written by Mulaney and Marika Sawyer and inspired by classic children's television series "Sesame Street", "The Electric Company" and "The Great Space Coaster".
Eli Bolin composed the music, with lyrics from Mulaney and Sawyer.
Performing with Mulaney are 15 child actors and singers, aged 8–13.
Celebrity cameos include Richard Kind, André De Shields, David Byrne, Natasha Lyonne, Annaleigh Ashford, and Jake Gyllenhaal as "Mr.
Music."
The program is a one-hour long variety special that presents itself as one episode of a larger series.
The special consists of several songs, skits, and activities interspersed with scripted segments of Mulaney chatting with the Bunch as well as unscripted interviews with both the children and the adult guest stars about their greatest fears and acting background.
Jake, ostensibly in character as a younger version of Mulaney, sings a song about his grandmother's boyfriend Paul and his many quirks, while wondering why the rest of his family hasn't accepted Paul.
Jonah summarizes a fictional book he has read called "Sascha's Dad Does Drag and the Act Needs Work", a book with a comically frank depiction of drag culture from the perspective of the son of an aging drag queen.
Mulaney plays the producer of a fictional Sony Animation film called "Bamboo 2: Bamboozled" which is being focus grouped by the entire Bunch.
The skit pokes fun at the kids' viewing habits and the tropes of modern western animation.
A father, played by Mulaney, hires a math tutor (André De Shields) to help his son Jonah with algebra.
The Tutor performs an elaborate Dixieland-style jazz number about how not knowing math caused him to lose his eye - however, it turns out to be a shaggy dog story, with his eye being unexpectedly saved at the last minute, and he reveals afterwards that he had simply lost his eye by accident while performing the song.
A transitional scene focused on Googy, supposedly a recurring "Sack Lunch Bunch" character, is interrupted when Mulaney is forced to reveal to the kids that the actor who played Googy passed away, subsequently having a frank conversation about death.
During lunchtime, Orson breaks into song about how he will only ever eat one food: "a plain plate of noodles with a little bit of butter."
Mulaney and Tyler play a chess game and continually try to throw one another off with existential questions and absurd facts.
Suri urges Mulaney to play "restaurant" with her, only for the game to end abruptly when Suri refuses to allow him entry into her imaginary restaurant.
Actor Richard Kind has an unscripted discussion with Ava, Cordelia, and Camille about movies, his career, and their experiences in plays.
Nearly every sentence contains the phrase "girl talk."
Lexi and her friend prepare to put on a skit in front of the guests at her parents' dinner party.
However, when all of the guests talk over the performance, she and her friend (David Byrne) launch into a musical number urging the guests to pay attention and explaining what they planned to do in the skit, including cartwheels, acting out the entirety of "Frozen", and a fake newscast while wearing an enormous blazer.
Zell and Oriah perform a dramatic '80s-inspired power ballad wondering what happens to flowers at night.
Jacob and David Byrne make a papier-mâché volcano despite Byrne's childhood fear of volcanoes.
While Mulaney asks about the Bunch's top New York moments, Alex recalls a time he was in New York and saw a woman (Annaleigh Ashford) crying on the street.
He wonders in song about what would happen if he had gone up to her and asked what was wrong, and imagines the friendship they may have shared if he had done so.
Special guest Mr. Music (Jake Gyllenhaal) attempts to demonstrate how one can make music without instruments.
However Mr. Music, having failed to prepare for his segment, grows increasingly exasperated as the objects around the studio he tries to use as examples fail to make any sound.
The special ends with a final round of interviews with all of the child and adult performers.
While appearing on "Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj", Mulaney described the special as being inspired by other educational children's programs such as "Sesame Street", "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood", "The Electric Company", and even more specifically, shows like "Free to Be... You and Me", and "3-2-1 Contact".
According to "Variety", the special is co-written by Marika Sawyer ("Saturday Night Live") and music composer Eli Bolin ("Sesame Street", "Original Cast Album: Co-Op"), who drew inspiration from musical influences including Burt Bacharach, Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, and Trinidadian calypso legend Mighty Sparrow.
They turned to pieces like Maurice Sendak and Carole King's "Really Rosie", which Mulaney remembered from childhood, and Harry Nilsson's "The Point," which were also fueled by catchy songs and extremely relatable anxieties.
"As a kid, we watched movies like "Little Shop of Horrors" and "Clue", and they didn't seem inappropriate – and I don't think they are," Mulaney says.
"But they had a lot of tension to them."
On November 22, 2019, Mulaney tweeted a poster of "The Sack Lunch Bunch" which was in the style of the artwork for the cast recording album of "A Chorus Line".
On December 12, 2019, Netflix released a teaser in promotion for the special which plays as an homage to Bob Fosse's classic film "All That Jazz".
The teaser opens as an almost shot for shot recreation of the opening of "All That Jazz", with Mulaney dressed all in black playing the role of Roy Scheider's Fosse.
The special has been universally praised, receiving an 95% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes and has an 87% on Metacritic.
Critic Alan Sepinwall of "Rolling Stone Magazine", wrote "It is, like "Galaxy Quest", or "The Princess Bride", one of those gems that manages to simultaneously parody a genre and be an excellent recreation of it."
Critic Erik Adams, from "The A.V.
Club" gave the special an A rating, writing, "The Sack Lunch Bunch is an unconventional package, but its ingredients are pure John Mulaney".
Richard Roeper of "The Chicago Sun-Times", and John Anderson of "The Wall Street Journal" both praised the special describing it more as "effective conceptual art than a variety show".
Mulaney has suggested in an interview with "Vulture" that he hopes to do another "Sack Lunch Bunch" special, and that he has material that didn't make it into the first one that he hopes to explore in later specials.

By 1863, the church became too small, and Alnön new church was built nearby.
After that, the old church was disused and only restored in the 1927 under direction of Erik Salvén.
Medieval frescoes from around 1500 have been preserved.
The church used to keep a wooden baptismal font made in the 13th century, however, it has been moved to the new church.
The weathercock on top of the church was voted in 2008 to be the Church Cock of the Year in Sweden.
The building is protected as a cultural heritage monument at the regional level.

Legend (Tchaikovsky)
Legend (Russian: Легенда, "Legenda"), Op.
54, No.
5 (also known as The Crown of Roses in some English-language sources) is a composition by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.
Originally written in 1883 as a song for solo voice and piano, it was subsequently arranged by Tchaikovsky for solo voice and orchestra (1884), and then for unaccompanied choir (1889).
The words are based on the poem "Roses and Thorns" by American poet Richard Henry Stoddard, originally published in "Graham's Magazine" of May 1856.
Stoddard's poem was translated into Russian by the poet, Aleksey Pleshcheyev and published in the Russian journal "Sem'ia i shkola" ("Family and School") in 1877.
Pleshcheyev described the origin of the poem only as "translated from the English", without crediting Stoddard, the nature of whose contribution was thus lost.
The poem was included in Pleshcheyev's anthology "Snowdrop" (Подснeжник; 1878), where it was found by Tchaikovsky.
When "Legend" is sung by English-speaking choirs, the words used are usually those of Geoffrey Dearmer, who translated Pleschcheyev's Russian text back into English for the "English Carol Book" (1913).
Dearmer himself was only 20 years old when he wrote the words.
While Pleshcheyev's Russian lyrics are a literal translation of Stoddard, and also copy the original rhyming scheme ABCB, Dearmer uses considerable poetic licence and a new rhyming scheme of AABB.
The song is in the key of E minor, but the lack of any accidentals in the melody gives it a modal character.
The original form of the song has a brief piano introduction and coda.
This is retained in the orchestral arrangement.
In the choral arrangement, the introduction is eliminated, and the piano coda is replaced by a choral coda featuring extremely low basses.
The melody of the original version is shown below:

The original version of the music, for solo voice and piano, was published as part of Tchaikovsky's "Songs for Chidren", Op.
54, in 1884.
The orchestra arrangement was made for tenor Dmitri Usatov, who premiered it in April 1884 at the Bolshoi Theatre.
The choral arrangement was premiered by the Chorus of the Imperial Opera under the direction of Fyodor Becker in March 1889.
Both the orchestral and choral arrangements were published in 1890.
The choral arrangement was subsequently performed under Tchaikovsky's direction at the official opening concert of Carnegie Hall in May 1891.
According to the "New York Times" review, it "made a great hit", with the composer being "called out twice after it with great enthusiasm".
An English translation, "When Jesus Christ was yet a child", was made by Geoffrey Dearmer and published in "The English Carol Book" in 1913.
The song was the basis of Anton Arensky's Variations on a Theme by Tchaikovsky, Op.
35a (1894), for string orchestra.

Keep On Chooglin' (song)
"Keep On Chooglin'" is a song written by John Fogerty that was first released as the final song on Creedence Clearwater Revival's 1969 album "Bayou Country".
The song was often used to close Creedence Clearwater Revival concerts and was later covered by several other artists including Fogerty as a solo artist.
The song popularized the neologism "chooglin'."
According to John Fogerty, he began working on "Keep On Chooglin'" (as well as "Born on the Bayou" and "Proud Mary," which also appeared on "Bayou Country") during his time in the US Army Reserves.
He continued working on those songs after his discharge and throughout most of 1968, during which time he came up with the idea to cross-reference the songs as part of a "swamp bayou myth."
John Fogerty biographer Thomas M. Kitts describes "Keep On Chooglin'" as "an energetic rave."
The song builds into a boogie as John Fogerty plays variations on the opening guitar riff and incorporates solos on his harmonica.
John Fogerty claims that some of his guitar playing on "Keep on Chooglin'" is based on the playing of Charlie Christian.
Kitts describes Doug Clifford's drums as "pounding," Stu Cook's bass guitar as "thumping" and Tom Fogerty's rhythm guitar chords as "slashing."
Music writer Steven L. Hamelman praises Clifford's drumming on the song as "a brilliant groove, never wavering."
The song popularized the term "chooglin', which may have been invented by Fogerty."
The lyrics tell the listener that he or she should "keep on chooglin'."
John Fogerty explained the term chooglin' as "what happens when 'you got to ball and have a good time.'"
Similar to Fogerty's explanation, Cook viewed chooglin' as a metaphor for sex.
Lyrics of the song such as "Here comes Louie, works in the sewer, he gonna choogle tonight" imply that chooglin' is especially done by the working class, but other lyrics such as "if you can choose it, who can refuse it, y'all be chooglin' tonight" imply that everyone can choogle.
Clifford described the message to keep on chooglin' as inspirational, "It means keep on going, keep on truckin'.
Things may be bad and look bleak, but believe in yourself, pull up the old bootstraps and get the job done."
According to "Village Voice" critic Robert Christgau, the verb "choogle" "has more to do with vigor than with potency, more to do with simple activity than with sexuality."
"Keep On Chooglin'" has some relationship to "Bootleg," another song from "Bayou Country" in that the singer appears to be a marginalized figure.
The two songs also share similar riffs, and were both designed as "concert ravers."
"Keep On Chooglin'" and "Bootleg" (as well as some other Creedence songs) were both used to demonstrate the similarities between different songs as part of Fogerty's defense in the lawsuit brought against him by Fantasy Records, in which Fantasy claimed that Fogerty's solo song "The Old Man Down the Road" copied the melody from "Run Through the Jungle," a song which Fantasy held the rights to.
"Keep On Chooglin'" also relates to several other songs on "Bayou Country" as one of several songs that maintain an illusion that the band is from the Louisiana backwoods, a group that also includes "Born on the Bayou," "Proud Mary" and "Graveyard Train."
Creedence Clearwater Revival often used "Keep On Chooglin'" as their final song in live concerts.
Although the album version lasted a little under 8 minutes, in concert the song could extend for more than 15 minutes.
Live versions have been included on several Creedence Clearwater Revival live albums, including "Live in Europe", "The Concert" and "Live at Woodstock".
"Keep On Chooglin'" was included on the soundtrack of the 1980 Art Linson film "Where the Buffalo Roam".
John Fogerty has frequently played "Keep On Chooglin'" in his live solo concerts.
Versions have been included on several of his albums, including "The Long Road Home – In Concert" and "", as well as a special edition of "Revival".
The Hammersmith Gorillas covered "Keep On Chooglin'" on their 1999 album "Gorilla Got Me".
Lee Benoit covered it on his 2000 album "Dis 'N' Dat".

Hay-a-Park Gravel Pit
Hay-a-Park Gravel Pit is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, or SSSI, adjacent to the east side of the town of Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, England.
Having been a disused and flooded quarry since the 1970s, it now consists of the large Hay-a-Park Lake and three smaller ponds, besides associated reedbeds, scrub, woodland and grassland.
It was designated as a SSSI in 1995 because it supports a number of wintering birds, including a large flock of goosander.
This site is "one of the most northerly inland breeding populations of reed warbler in Britain."
Hay-a-Park was once part of a royal park, an early landowner being Edward II.
The area once belonged to the Crown; then Edward II gave it to his favourite, Piers Gaveston.
After Gaveston was executed, it passed back to the Crown, but was subject to poaching for some time.
In the 14th century the area was known as "Park de la Haye" where Edward III bred horses.
Edward's fifteen-year-old wife Philippa of Hainault was given this land on the occasion of her marriage; she was later the mother of the Black Prince (whose statue stands in Leeds City Square) and John of Gaunt.
Another story says that in the 11th or 12th century Henry I conferred the lands to Gamel de Scriven, and they remained in the family under various names including Edward II until the last heir, Sir Charles Slingsby, died falling from his horse into the river in 1869, leaving no issue.
The area later became known as "Haya Park".
By the seventeenth century the land was at least partly wooded, and managed for timber.
By the end of that century it was owned by Lady Hewley, who used its rents to support the Church and charities.
When its farmland was valued in 1755 by Robert Moody of York, the land was considered potentially good for cultivation, but contemporary farmers were "poor idle drunken ignorant fellows" who spent Sundays in the alehouse; so that the land was "miserably run and full of weeds," with no prospect of land improvement.
In the 19th century the leasehold of Haya Park was purchased for the purpose of rectorial tithes by York Minster; it was still a royal park, where deer were protected.
Part of Hay-a-Park later became a gravel works, and the site occupies a section which has been "largely undisturbed since the completion of extraction in the early 1970s."
Hay-a-Park Gravel Pit is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), consisting of "standing open water and canals."
This reserve has no parking area, no visitor facilities, and no official public footpaths.
Fishing and swimming are not permitted, and dog-walking is discouraged due to disturbance of water birds.
The site is adjacent to the eastern edge of Knaresborough, accessible by public footpath from two unlabelled entrances on Park Lane, one located near the railway bridge, and the other next to Knaresborough Rugby Club.
The site was first notified on 15 June 1995, being "of interest for its breeding birds and wintering wildfowl."
It is one of about eight SSSIs in the Harrogate region, others being Ripon Parks, Farnham Mires, Hack Fall Wood, Cow Myers, Mar Field Fen, Quarry Moor, and Bishop Monkton Ings.
As described by Natural England in 1995, the site contains the 24-hectare Hay-a-Park Lake at the north end of the site, "three small ponds" at the south end, and "associated areas of reedbed, scrub, mature hedgerow and grassland," however as of 2019 much of the scrub had become woodland.
Of "national importance" are the goosander which winter here, numbering up to 315 birds as counted in 1995.
Of "local importance" are wigeon, greylag, coot and mallard.
In spring, oystercatcher, wigeon and various geese graze on the adjacent field.
Tufted duck, mallard and great crested grebe breed on or near Hay-a-Park Lake, as do common sandpiper and ringed plover.
Grasshopper warbler and sedge warbler breed on the small ponds.
The reed warbler breeds here too, being "one of the most northerly inland breeding populations of reed warbler in Britain."
The fly "Raphium laticorne" has been found in "nine lowland localities" in Yorkshire including at Hay-a-Park, and "Campsicnemus marginatus" has also been found here.
Although the former quarry pit Hay-a-Park Lake may be deep, Natural England recommends that the presence of any shallow water areas be maintained.
This is for the benefit of wintering waders and feeding ducks and geese.
Shallow waters allow aquatic plants to receive light, thereby allowing breeding conditions for dragonflies and damselflies.
"Protection of appropriate water quality" is required, as is regulation of potential incoming water and sediment.
"Bottom feeding coarse fish" must be removed, because they may "uproot plants and disturb sediments."
"Appropriate nesting and feeding conditions are maintained" with regard to open land, scrub and reeded areas.
"Recreational activities should be managed sympathetically to avoid conflict with the management of the waterbody for nature conservation," and "recreational use of woodland should be discouraged" should the site contain a heronry.
A 2012 assessment of the site was "unfavourable, declining."
Notices have been erected at two entrance points of the site, to remind the public that there has been a continuing concern about "illegal fishing" here.
There are also issues of freshwater fish-stocking, public access and disturbance.
A woman was photographed swimming recreationally in the lake in winter 2019, putting greylags to flight.
Some visitors to Hay-a-Park have been carrying out three categories of "operations likely to damage the special interest," namely articles 16a, 27 and 28 of Natural England's views about management of the SSSI.
Nevertheless, the published audit for the Knaresborough Development Plan of 2016 described the site as being available for recreational use, and designated it as an "important community area" (ICA).

SS Fort Camosun
SS "Fort Camosun" was coal-burning 7000-ton freighter, built in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada in 1942.
In June of 1942, during World War 2, she departed Victoria Harbour on her maiden voyage to England with zinc, lead, plywood, timber and other raw materials.
On 20 June 1942 the Japanese submarine I-25, under the command of Commander Meiji Tagami, torpedoed the "Fort Camosun" while she was 70 miles south-southwest of Cape Flattery.
"Fort Camosun" was torpedoed just eleven hours out of port at 11:00pm.
The torpedo hit the number two hold on the port side.
The crew abandoned ship into the remaining good lifeboats.
The submarine then surfaced used deck guns to fire 18 shells at the "Fort Camosun" causing further damage to the ship.
While badly damaged the "Fort Camosun" did not sink, as she was loaded with plywood, timber and other floatable cargo.
The crew radioed for help and later an American Flying Fortress located the crew.
Later in the day the HMCS Edmundston] rescued the 31 crew of the sinking "Fort Camosun".
The "Fort Camosun" was towed to safety by to Neah Bay.
The "Fort Camosun" was low in the water and was towed with the help of the tugboat "Henry Foss" from Tacoma, US Navy tug USS "Tatnuck" and the tugboat "Salvage Queen".
"Fort Camosun" reached Neah Bay, later she was towed to Esquimalt B.C.
At Esquimalt she was put in dry dock and tempory repairs were made.
"Fort Camosun" repaired took timber to England, via Guantanamo and New York.
On the way to England an U-Boat attacked her convoy in the Atlantic.
As she was passing through the North Channel alone a German aircraft tried to bomb her, but the bomb landed clear of the ship.
Later she survived another torpedo attack in the Gulf of Aden.
"I-25" was later sunk by one or more of the destroyers , , which were involved in the naval engagement on 3 September 1943 off the New Hebrides islands approximately northeast of Espiritu Santo.
Which American ship sank the "I-25" remains unknown.

2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Final
The 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Final was a beach soccer match which took place on 1 December 2019 at Los Pynandi World Cup Stadium in Luque, Paraguay, to determine the winners of the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.
It was the final and hence the last match of the 10th FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, a biennial competition contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA.
As the fourth all-European final (following 2001, 2005 and 2013), the match pitted the European champions of 2018 and 2019 respectively against each other: Italy, who had previously competed in one World Cup final, in 2008, and Portugal, who appeared in their third FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup final and their sixth overall when taking into account the pre-FIFA era "Beach Soccer World Championships"; their last appearance was four years prior in 2015.
In what was seen as an evenly contested affair, Portugal emerged as victors thanks to a series of successful free kicks, clinching the match by six goals to four to win their second FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup crown (following 2015) and third world title overall (including success in the 2001 World Championship), condemning Italy to a second runners-up medal.
The match was also notable as the 583rd and final international beach soccer appearance of Madjer; the Portuguese captain, often hailed as the best player of all-time, announced his retirement immediately following the match.
Italian captain, Francesco Corosiniti, also retired following the match, his 263rd cap.
Both nations are veterans at World Cups, with Portugal missing only one and Italy, two, since their debuts (1997 and 1995 respectively).
The former had had considerably more success than the latter.
During the "World Championships" era, Portugal became champions in 2001 and finished on the podium a further four times (1999, 2002, 2003, 2004).
Since the FIFA era began, Portugal have fared relatively similarly, winning the 2015 title, finishing as runners-up in 2005 and earning bronze medals three times (2008, 2009, 2011).
This was Portugal's third FIFA final and sixth overall.
Italy's best finish of the World Championships was a single bronze medal, in 1996.
Italy reached their first final during the FIFA era in 2008, when they lost to Brazil 5–3, and this remained their only podium finish of this era until now.
This was Italy's second World Cup final.
However, more recently, after neither team qualified for 2013, Italy had reached the semi-finals of the last two editions, one better than their Iberian opponents.
Both teams had enjoyed generally successful seasons but not without some negatives.
As European nations, they had competed in many of the same events.
Portugal failed in qualification for the World Beach Games, but compensated for this disappointment by claiming the gold medal at the European Games and becoming six-time European champions at the Euro Beach Soccer League (EBSL).
Despite reaching this final, they narrowly qualified for the World Cup in July, finishing in the final qualification spot, but also won the silver medal at the Mediterranean Beach Games.
Portugal were world ranked 4th going into the match.
Italy went into the season as reigning European champions having won the 2018 EBSL and began the year by qualifying for the World Beach Games were they went on to lose to Iran in the bronze medal match.
They only managed a fifth place finish at the European Games, but claimed fourth in the EBSL and second place in qualification for the World Cup.
The Mediterranean Beach Games was their most successful event, where they claimed the gold medal.
Italy were world ranked 3rd going into the match.
The teams had gone head-to-head three times previously at World Cups, twice during the World Championships era and once in the FIFA era.
The three meetings are documented below:
The teams had already met on three previous occasions in 2019, with Italy winning two, however Portugal had won the most recent contest.
Before then, the teams had not clashed for over two years.
However, overall, the two teams had met 48 times previously.
The last five meetings are documented in the below table:
Period one began with Portugal on the offensive and Italy on the defensive, the latter's style compared to the "Catenaccio" tactics classically used by their national football team.
Hence the Portuguese were the team creating the goal-scoring opportunities and dominating play, but on six minutes, Italy scored against the run of play – after a shot from Madjer (Portugal's twelfth of the match), Corosiniti played a ball through the middle to Zurlo who slotted home Italy's first shot of the match.
90 seconds later, Chiavaro fouled Leo Martins up against the touchline, just outside the Italian penalty area.
The Portuguese smashed his free kick into the bottom left hand corner to equalise the score.
Portugal continued to dominate, having over 70% possession of the ball, but Italy began creating opportunities of their own as the period neared its end.
After an injury timeout following Corosiniti and Belchior's clash, the period concluded with the score still level at 1–1.
The second period started with a more even spread of chances for both teams.
Del Mestre was forced into good saves from Jordan and then Be Martins, whilst, Gori and Zurlo saw their free kicks go narrowly wide for Italy.
In the sixth minute, the deadlock was broken.
Leo Martins won possession just inside his own half and lead Portugal on a quick counterattack, ultimately squaring the ball to an unmarked Jordan in the middle who fired home at the edge of the box.
30 seconds after the restart, Jordan won a long-range free kick, with his effort saved by a diving Del Mestre.
However, the Italian mistakenly parried the ball back into the centre of the box; with the goal left undefended, Lourenço pounced onto the loose ball for a tap in, putting Portugal up 3–1.
Despite the two goal gap, the game remained balanced as the second half of period two progressed; Leo Martins wasted a great chance, a one-on-one opportunity against the goalkeeper, shooting wide.
Jordan converted a powerful free kick from the centre of the pitch during the opening stages of period three to open up a 4–1 lead for Portugal.
This deficit saw Italy become more offensive to try and bridge the gap.
One minute later, Jordan was guilty of a foul on Gori, conceding a penalty, but the Italian's spot kick attempt was saved by Andrade.
The attacking play of Italy began opening up more spaces for Portugal to exploit.
Soon after, Leo Martins completed a brace from a free kick given away by Marinai just outside the Italian box, extending the Portuguese lead to 5–1 with just eight minutes left on the clock.
Protests surrounding the foul lead to a flurry of yellow cards, for Jordan, Del Mestre and Chiavaro.
After a Corosiniti effort hit the post, Italy scored two goals inside the 31st minute.
First a one-two between Zurlo and Ramacciotti saw the latter slotting past Andrade at close range.
And then from Ramacciotti's corner, Josep Junior ran from deep to head in at the back post for 5–3, reigniting the match as a contest, seeing Portugal take a more cautious approach into the final minutes.
Gori almost made it 5–4 with two minutes left, hitting a bicycle kick against the post, but a controversial foul by Ramacciotti mere seconds later (for which he was booked) allowed Jordan to complete his hat-trick via the free kick.
Italy's remaining efforts proved futile, save for a final attempt by Ramacciotti through Andrade's legs mere seconds from full time.
But the goal bothered Portugal not as they knew they had the game won, and as the last seconds ticked by, the TV cameras were already focused on Madjer on the Portuguese bench who had begun crying.

Being widely regarded as the greatest player of all-time, his announcement was met with an outpouring of tributes from fellow players and media outlets.
Madjer revealed the news in an emotional speech to the media:
""A big hug to all Portuguese, I thank from the bottom of my heart all the support you have given me throughout my career.
I owe a lot to you, I owe a lot to this team, I owe a lot to everyone.
Today was my last game..."" *begins crying* ""...I want to thank all Portuguese, all my colleagues, coaches, all the staff, people who worked with me until today.
To say that I leave happy, fulfilled, proud to be Portuguese, and above all proud of this family that has been building more beautiful beach soccer, with fair play around the world.
Thank you, Portuguese pride!"."

List of African-American newspapers in Nevada
This is a list of African-American newspapers that have been published in the state of Nevada.
Nevada was "the last state to remove itself from the list of states that have never had a Black newspaper" in the mid-20th century.
While the late 19th century saw a flourishing African American press in many other Western states and territories, Nevada's African-American population at the time was very low, falling as low as 134 in 1900.
As a result, during that early period, "no Negro-owned newspaper, even of the most ephemeral kind, was published in Nevada."
To be included in this list, a periodical should be mentioned in a reliable source as an African-American newspaper published in Nevada.

Ratabon was born in Montpellier, the son of Jean de Ratabon, an equerry, and Catherine Pache from Servien, near Mende.
He became Maître d'Hôtel Ordinaire of King Louis XIV, Trésorier Général de France at Montpellier, and Intendant des Gabelles of Languedoc.
In Paris he became First Assistant to François Sublet de Noyers, who was the Surintendant des Bâtiments under Cardinal Richelieu, and continued in this role under Étienne Le Camus, who succeeded Sublet de Noyers as Surintendant after the latter's dismissal under Cardinal Mazarin in 1643.
Ratabon succeeded Le Camus in 1656.
Ratabon relinquished the post to Jean-Baptiste Colbert on 1 January 1664.
In his role as Surintendant des Bâtiments, Ratabon ordered the demolition of the Hôtel du Petit-Bourbon in October 1660 to make way for the eastward expansion of the Louvre and construction of the Louvre Colonnade.
The order resulted in the eviction without warning of the troupe of Molière from the theatre of the Petit Bourbon and their transfer to the disused and run-down theatre of the Palais-Royal.

The Battalion suffered from very high rates of dengue fever during the Guam campaign and while this was not fatal it did incapacitate many Marines.
Like all other defense battalions in 1944, the unit was re-designated and the 9th was renamed the 9th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion in September, 1944.
The unit remained on Guam for the duration of the war and returned to the U.S. in 1946.

Grizzly Mountain (Canada)
Grizzly Mountain is a mountain summit located in Glacier National Park, in the Hermit Range of the Selkirk Mountains in British Columbia, Canada.
Grizzly Mountain is situated northeast of Revelstoke, and west of Golden.
It is also set north of Cheops Mountain, and west of Rogers Pass from which it can be seen from the Trans-Canada Highway.
The closest peak to Grizzly is Ursus Minor Mountain, to the west-southwest, and its nearest higher peak is Mount Sifton, to the north.
The first ascent of the mountain was made August 31, 1901, by John E. Bushnell, August S. Eggers, Karl Schuluneggar, and Friedrich Michel via the southeast couloir.
The first ascent of the north ridge was made in 1921 by Neal Carter, Tom Fyles, and Don Munday.
The west ridge was first climbed by Georgia Engelhard and Ernest Feuz in 1933.
The mountain's name was adopted in 1906, then re-approved September 8, 1932, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada.
It was so-named because of its proximity above Bear Creek (since renamed Connaught Creek), and in keeping with the bear theme of other nearby features such as Ursus Major Mountain, Ursus Minor Mountain, Bruins Pass, and Balu Pass.
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Grizzly Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.
Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.
Precipitation runoff from the mountain and meltwater from a small unnamed glacier on its northwest slope drains into tributaries of the Beaver River and Illecillewaet River.
2019–20 Naisten Liiga season
The 2019–20 Naisten Liiga season is the thirty-seventh season of the Naisten Liiga, the premier level of women's ice hockey in Finland, since the league’s establishment in 1982.
The season format designated for the 2019–20 season was a modified version of the format established for the 2018–19 season.
While the opening series remained unchanged, the divisional series was expanded to six teams in each division.
In order to fill the two empty slots of the Lower Division, two teams from the Naisten Mestis were added to the Liiga for the divisional series and onward.
The playoff format was modified to account for the increased number of teams; eight teams would qualify for the playoffs rather than the previous six.
This change allowed for a traditional single-elimination tournament to be played from the quarterfinal stage rather than having the top two teams automatically progress to the semifinal round.
Preliminary series
The preliminary series () is played as a double round-robin plus a two-game Opening Weekend Tournament; each of the ten teams plays a total of twenty matches.
Points are awarded by match outcome, regulation wins earn three points, overtime wins earn 2 points, overtime losses earn 1 point, and no points are awarded for regulation losses.
The points earned in the opening series determine which division a team will be sorted for the continuation of the season.
Divisional series
In the divisional series, the teams are grouped into two divisions of six teams.
Each division is played as a double round-robin, each team plays a total of ten games.
The top six ranked teams in the preliminary series qualify for the Upper Division ().
Upper Division teams are guaranteed placement in the playoffs; the points earned in the ten divisional series games are added to the points totals from the preliminary series and used to establish the teams' playoff berths, from first to sixth.
The bottom four teams in the opening series move on to the Lower Division (), where they are joined by the top two teams from the Cross-Qualifiers () of the Naisten Mestis, the league directly below Naisten Liiga.
The Lower Division teams compete for the seventh and eighth seed positions in the playoffs; only the top two ranked teams from the Lower Division earn places in the playoffs.
Unlike the in Upper Division, all Lower Division teams start the divisional series with zero points, only points earned in the series are considered when the teams are ranked.
Qualifying series
The Lower Division teams ranked third through sixth continue on to the qualifying series ().
The points earned in the six qualifying series games are added to the points totals from the Lower Division divisional series.
The two teams with the highest point totals qualify for the 2020–21 Naisten Liiga season, the two lower ranked teams are relegated to the Naisten Mestis for the following season.
Teams promoted from the Naisten Mestis to the Lower Division
Series was played from 7 September to 24 November 2019.
Top six teams advanced to the Upper Division (), while teams ranking sixth through tenth progressed to the Lower Division ().

Oola Castle
Oola Castle is a tower house located in County Limerick, Ireland.
Oola Castle is located east of the village of Oola.
It lies in the Golden Vale, southeast of Limerick.
It should not be confused with the castle in Ballyneety nearby, which is sometimes called "Oola Castle."
The current building dates to the late 16th century and was built by the O'Briens.
It is classified as a "later" tower house; according to Claire Foley and Colm Donnelly, "greater provision of heat and light, married to Renaissance concepts of symmetry, was incorporated into the traditional building form to create a new tower-house paradigm, as expressed at buildings such as Oola [Castle]."
In 1825, antlers of the Irish elk were discovered; and, in 1828, a bronze trumpet, spear and arrow heads of bronze were found.
Both were placed in the museum of Trinity College, Dublin.
A local legend concerns a princess named Theresa who lived in the castle in the 18th century; she was very fond of oranges and was later forced to move to County Cavan for unclear reasons.
The castle is a square six-storey limestone tower house.
There are circular bartizans on the northeast and southwest corners.
The upper windows have hood moulding, and the east and west walls have their original fireplaces.
When it was in use, it would have had whitewashed walls, gables crowned with chimneys and mullioned windows.

Anna Amtmann
Anna Amtmann is a Professor for Molecular Plant Physiology at the University of Glasgow.
She serves as Editor-in-Chief of the journal "Plant, Cell & Environment".
Amtmann studied mathematics and biology at the University of Paris and Heidelberg University.
She was an Erasmus Programme student at the University of Barcelona.
Amtmann completed her graduate degrees in biology in the laboratory of at the University of Göttingen.
Her doctoral research involved the use of electrophysiology to study unicellular marine algae, in an effort to understand how they maintain homeostasis for calcium and sodium ions.
In 1993, after earning her PhD, Amtmann investigated ion transport properties in barley in Dale Sanders' laboratory at the University of York.
Whilst at York she developed microarrays that could be used to monitor how ion transporters responded to nutrient deficiency and salinity.
Amtmann was appointed a lecturer at the University of Glasgow in 2001 and was promoted to Professor in 2014.
She spent 2007 on sabbatical at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Golm.
Her research considers the mechanisms by which plants adapt to nutrient deficiency, drought and salinity.
She has explored how solar-powered microorganisms could be used to extra salt from seawater.
Salt is toxic in seawater because it causes dehydration in cells and can distort the shape of proteins.
Marine organisms have developed strategies to avoid toxicity, and Amtmann looks to identify these organisms, fit them with molecular engines and encourage them to take up salt until they are saturated with salt.
The salt-packed cells will die and can be removed from the system, leaving fresh water and a waste product that can be used for bio-cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
Amtmann's research has been supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.
She leads "Algae UK", one of six Networks in Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy (NIBBs) that look to support the UK's transition to a low carbon economy.
Algae UK looks to increase research and development into high value products created from microalgae and macroalgae, as well as increasing attention to cyanobacterial synthetic biology.
Amtmann is the editor-in-chief of "Plant, Cell & Environment".
Amtmann is married to Pawel Herzyk, who she met during her first postdoctoral position at the University of York.
Together they have twin boys.

The facility, which was designed by a Mr Johnson of Sheffield in the Jacobean style, opened as Bakewell Union Workhouse in 1841.
A large infirmary block was built to the rear of the site in 1900.
It became the Bakewell Public Assistance Institution in 1930 and then joined the National Health Service as Newholme Hospital in 1948.
Although it was announced in July 2017 that the hospital would close, it was confirmed, in December 2018, that a new health hub would be built on part of the site.
Køpi
Køpi (also known as Köpi or Koepi) is a housing project (German: "Hausprojekt") located at 137 Köpenicker Straße in Mitte, Berlin.
It was squatted in 1990 and legalised in 1991 as an autonomous housing project and self-managed social centre.
The yard was used as a "wagenplatz" for people living in vehicles.
It is a left-wing project, connected to punks, anarchists and Autonomen.
The building has become a symbol for the radical left in Berlin in the same manner as Rozbrat in Poznań or Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen.
It has survived several eviction attempts both through political pressure and because the developers have always run out of money.
The building was constructed in 1905 for a Jewish businessman.
A symmetrical Gründerzeit facade stands flanked by two short wings.
What can be seen from the street used to be the back of the building, since the front half was destroyed by bombing at the end of World War II and was never rebuilt.
The surfaces of the building are damaged from the bombs and subsequent neglect, with most of the stucco gone.
During World War II, the building was used by the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (the general electricity company) to house French forced labourers.
After the war, the building lay in East Berlin.
Under the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the building was used for sports activities and there was a bowling alley in the basement.
By 1990, it had become vacant and was scheduled to be demolished.
Køpi was squatted on February 23, 1990, by Autonomen from West Berlin.
Despite the terrible state of the building, the squatters were attracted by the large rooms.
