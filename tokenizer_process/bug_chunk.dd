Unlikely Stories, Mostly
Unlikely Stories, Mostly is the first collection of short stories by Alasdair Gray, published in 1983.
"Unlikely Stories, Mostly" was released as a Canongate hardback in 1983; an erratum slip was inserted into the first edition that read "This slip has been inserted by mistake."
A Penguin Books paperback was issued in 1984.
"Five Letters from an Eastern Empire" was issued as a stand-alone work in 1995 as part of Penguin's '60 shilling' series.
A revised edition with the extra stories "A Unique Case" and "Inches in a Column" in thirteenth and fourteenth place, and a new postscript by Douglas Gifford, was released in 2010.
"Logopandocy" is retitled "Sir Thomas's Logopandocy", and "Prometheus" as "M. Pollard's Prometheus" in this edition.
In 2012 the entire work was included in Gray's collection "Every Short Story 1951–2012".
Like Gray's best-known work "", the book was published in the 1980s but contains work going back thirty years.
Writing in the "London Review of Books", Daniel Eilon contrasted the variable quality and experimental nature of the first seven stories with the next five, which he called the "real achievement of this work", and the final two shorter pieces.
While suggesting the collection could have benefited from some editing out of weaker material, he described "Logopandocy" as "an extraordinary feat of imaginative insight."
Theo Tait, in "The Guardian", wrote that "Unlikely Stories, Mostly" is Gray's best short-story collection, and is influenced by Kafka, Jonathan Swift, and Samuel Johnson's "Rasselas".
He considered "Five Letters From An Eastern Empire" to be the highlight of the collection.
In the "Financial Times", Angel Gurria-Quintana compared Gray's illustrations with those of William Blake.
Gray used his epigram "Work as if you were living in the early days of a better nation" in the book.
"Unlikely Stories, Mostly" won the Cheltenham Prize for Literature in 1983.

Pikauba (cheese)
The Pikauba is a semi-firm cheese, farmer made by hand, in the region Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean in Quebec.
It takes its name from a river, Pikauba River, that crosses the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
It is recognized by its fine orange rind and its soft, golden paste, strewn with small holes.
Medium in intensity, Pikauba has a buttery taste with fruity aromas.
It comes in 2.5 kg or 5 kg format.
Pikauba is made at Lehman cheese dairy located in Hébertville in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (Quebec).
The quality of the fodder plants, the freshness of the cool climate as well as the terroir of the region offer favorable conditions for cheese making.
The Lehmann Cheese Factory has been in existence since 2001.
It is from the recipe, scribbled on a piece of paper by his mother from Jura Switzerland, that Jacob Lehman makes the first cheeses.
The cheese family says that a quote from Félix Leclerc provided them with the inspiration to produce cheese:"“Our lives are like rivers; the calm is deep, the restless flow on the surface.”" The Pikauba was produced for the first time in 2005.
A novel by Gérard Bouchard is also entitled "Pikauba"a,
This semi-soft, washed rind cheese is made with thermised cow's milk.
Maturing lasts between 90 and 120 days.
Production is based on a herd of 60 Brown Swiss cows, which is said to be the oldest dairy breed.
This mountain cow is appreciated for its ability to give rich milk and a very good cheese yield.

Jacob Nicolai Møller
Jacob Nicolai Møller, also known as Jacques-Nicolas Moeller (1777–1862) was a Norwegian scientist and philosopher of the Romantic period.
Møller was born in Porsgrund on 6 February 1777, the son of a doctor.
After studying at Copenhagen University and gaining a reputation for brilliance, he passed the Danish civil service exam and was awarded a travel bursary to pursue further studies abroad in geology and mineralogy.
For two years he and his friend Henrik Steffens studied together in Berlin and later in Freiberg, under the mineralogist Abraham Gottlob Werner.
Møller then travelled to Paris, to study under René Just Haüy and Georges Cuvier, before rejoining Steffens at the University of Jena to sit at the feet of Friedrich Schelling.
After a conversion experience during an illness, he was received into the Catholic Church in Hamburg, on 27 January 1804, the day of his marriage to Elisabeth Charlotte Alberti.
His wife's sister was married to Ludwig Tieck.
Becoming a Catholic disqualified him from public service in Denmark–Norway, so he sought academic employment in Germany.
After some time in Munster, where he was supported by Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg-Stolberg, he taught at a Gymnasium in Nuremberg before becoming tutor to the young Prince Kinsky.
He went on to hold a number of short-lived teaching positions in Dresden, Vienna, Bonn and Dusseldorf, before being appointed "honorary professor" at the Catholic University of Leuven, in Belgium, where his son Jean Moeller was professor of history.
He taught philosophy there from 1837 to 1842.
He died in Leuven on 30 November 1862.
Møller published in the "Zeitschrift für speculative Physik" (edited by Schelling) and the "Kritische Journal der Philosophie" (co-edited by Schelling and Hegel), as well as in several other reviews, both in France and Germany.
Between 1839 and 1842 he published a series of articles on German philosophy in the "Revue de Bruxelles".

Amritsar 1919
Amritsar 1919: An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre (2019), is a book by Kim A. Wagner and published by Yale University Press, that aims to dispel myths surrounding the Jallianwala Bagh massacre that took place in Amritsar, India, on 13 April 1919.
In the absence of any photographs of the event and with significant differences between British and Indian accounts of how many were killed and how and why it happened, Wagner examines primary sources to trace the events leading up to the massacre and then discusses its aftermath.
According to Wagner, the background to the massacre starts with the Indian rebellion of 1857 and the subsequent British fear of a recurrence.
By 1919, Indians aspired to greater self-governance, a wish frustrated by the proposals of the Rowlatt Act.
The result was Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha movement, which persuaded Indians to pursue nonviolent resistance to the British.
Fearing another 1857, events in Amritsar unfolded into Indian political agitation, the arrest of two key Indian political leaders, and British panic.
Then came General Dyer's action towards a large peaceful crowd and the killings at Jallianwalla Bagh.
British authorities responded with martial law and the arrest and torture of a number of Indians in Amritsar.
Contrary to a number of widely held beliefs, Wagners research reveals an alternative number of how many were killed in the massacre, how many were found in the well and an account of why General Dyer acted as he did.
The book was released in 2019, the 100th anniversary of the massacre, and triggered responses in a number of publications including "The Hindustan Times", "The Telegraph" and the "London Review of Books".
Amongst the reviewers have been Sathnam Sanghera, Andrew Lycett, Tunku Varadarajan, Ferdinand Mount and Trevor Grundy.
"Amritsar 1919: An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre" was published in 2019 by Yale University Press.
It is available in hard back, paper back and an audio version narrated by Neil Shah.
The author is Kim A. Wagner, who lectures on colonial India and the British Empire at Queen Mary, University of London.
He previously authored "" and "Thuggee".
The book has 360 pages, 26 black and white illustrations, four maps and 12 chapters preceded by an introduction and a section on acknowledgements.
Following the twelfth chapter is a conclusion and epilogue.
Wagner explains that "the Amritsar Massacre isn’t understood very well", particularly in the absence of any photographs of the 13 April 1919 and with a significant variation in British and Indian accounts of how many were killed and how and why it happened.
In his book, he examines primary sources to trace the events leading up to the massacre and discusses its aftermath.
The book begins with a scene from Richard Attenborough’s 1982 film "Gandhi", what Wagner cites as the most popular depiction of the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre and “how many people today think of what was arguably the bloodiest massacre in the history of the British Empire”.
According to Wagner, understanding the massacre requires beginning with the Indian rebellion of 1857.
In 1919, the continuing fear of a revolution led to the proposal of the suppressive Rowlatt Act which would give the British powers to quash any political agitation, and contradicted the simultaneous British promises with the Indian National Congress to give greater involvement to Indians in government.
Mahatma Gandhi responded by proposing that all Indians oppose the Act and make a Satyagraha pledge, a promise to resist without using violence.
The subsequent call for general strikes in late March 1919 then led to the arrest of two local Indian leaders.
On 10 April 1919, upon hearing of the arrests, a crowd of Indians issued a petition for the release of their leaders.
When British officials panicked and fired in reaction to seeing the approaching crowd, riots erupted.
On that day, Wagner explained, “European civilians had been killed by Indian rioters, and white women had been attacked by brown men”, for the first time since 1857.
The British subsequently banned all future gatherings.
However, the ban was not widely acknowledged and “many either unaware of the proclamation or not believing that the British would actually resort to violence, proceeded to announce a meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh that would take place on April 13, 1919”.
The crowd at Jallianwalla Bagh was composed of mainly men and many from out of town, making up to 20,000 people, who had mostly come to celebrate a religious festival.
Speeches focussed on the Rowlatt Act, the call to release the two arrested local Indian leaders, and effects on Indians of the First World War.
In Wagner's words "on the 13th of April, 1919, there was nobody in Jallianwala Bagh who thought about independence.
They were not heroic freedom fighters.
They still had an abiding belief in the ultimate justice of the Raj, and they still thought of the British government as being the arbiter of justice".
When General Dyer arrived "he was overwhelmed by the sheer size of the gathering that he had walked in on" and assumed it was a rebellion.
Wagner explains that the British response was of "racialized fear and violent suppression".
Afterwards, there was no British help with removing the dead or medical assistance for the injured.
Instead, the British authorities imposed curfews, a crawling order and martial law and those suspected of being involved in the 10 April riots were arrested and tortured.
British censorship ensured suppression of the details of the Amritsar troubles and the massacre, until October 1919.
In July 1920, the matter was discussed in the House of Commons.
Some noted the “un-English” nature of what happened and took his actions as a "blemish on an otherwise untarnished British rule".
Others saw Dyer's actions as necessary.
Using primary sources to gather evidence, Wagner has clarified that the book aims to dispel a number of myths surrounding the events of the massacre in Amritsar on 13 April 1919.
Contrary to a number of widely held beliefs, Wagner's research reveals 500 to 600 is a more likely “plausible estimate” of the number killed at the Bagh on 13 April 1919, and that “eyewitness accounts recall only one or two bodies as having been recovered from the well inside the park”.
That number, however, he says, does not "actually change the enormity of what happened".
In 2019, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh, the book triggered responses in a number of publications including "The Spectator" by William Dalrymple, who noted that Wagner had used extensive primary sources in his research and "almost every sentence is footnoted — gets as close as we are ever likely to get to the truth of what happened in Jallianwalla Bagh.
In the process, he demolishes a large number of myths that have grown up around the event, both imperial and nationalist".
Andrew Lycett, writing in "The Telegraph", described the book as having skilfully mapped out the events.
Reporting in "The Times", Tunku Varadarajan agreed with Wagner that the book is a "a microhistory of a global event", aimed at neither those with "Raj nostalgia or Indian Nationalism".
These responses were also supported by John Newsinger.
However, Newsinger, with regards to the fear of another 1857, pointed out "one disagreement with Wagner's discussion of this is that on occasions it [the book] seems to suggest that the massacre was the result of a misunderstanding, that if the British had not been so obsessed with the events of the 1850s then the massacre might never have taken place".
Trevor Grundy recommended the book be taught at schools and colleges.
Ferdinand Mount in the "London Review of Books", noted that General Dyer's evidence is quoted at length in the book.
Both Grundy and Mount compared "Amritsar 1919" with Nick Lloyd's "The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day" (2011) and with Nigel Collett's "The Butcher of Amritsar" (2005).
Mount argued that Wagner had underplayed the personality of General Dyer, portraying him as "nothing exceptional ... and nothing extraordinary", instead emphasising that it was "brutality" in general that was the "driving principle of the Raj" rather than the personality of individuals.
Wagner responded to Mount's view that "Dyer and the massacre were unique" and that the massacre "was all down to the personality of one officer", by citing the other brutal incidents mentioned by Mount "in which British officers in India from 1857 onward resorted to exemplary and indiscriminate massacres", such as those ordered by Hector Munro, Frederick Cooper and General James Neill.
"Amritsar 1919" has also been reviewed along with other books revolved around the massacre, including Anita Anand's "The Patient Assassin".
Reviews also appeared in "The Hindustan Times", and other commentators have included Sathnam Sanghera.

Paul V. Malloy
Paul V. Malloy is the presiding circuit court judge for Ozaukee County, Wisconsin.
He graduated with a Batchelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1981, and received his law degree from John Marshall Law School (Chicago) in 1985.
He was appointed to the bench in 2002, then elected to a full six-year term in 2003.
He was re-elected in 2009 and 2015.
His term expires in 2021.
In October 2014, Circuit Court Judge Joseph Voiland described a confrontation in which he and Molloy were standing “nearly nose to nose” and Malloy was yelling “as loud as I have heard anyone yell before.
Malloy admitted yelling but said the "nose to nose" dispute was exaggerated because there was a desk and chair between them.
In August 2015, Voiland jailed a woman after a hearing in which Voiland said he didn’t believe her, though Malloy released the woman after her attorney argued that Voiland didn’t establish any legal basis for holding her or provide for her an alternative method to seek release.
Randy Koschnick, the district judge at the time but now the director of state courts, had to intervene at times in disputes between Malloy and Voiland, including in June 2016 after Malloy ordered Court Commissioner Barry Boline not to follow orders issued by Voiland.
Voiland, speaking to a state investigator two years later, said he didn’t feel safe in his office after that and considered having security cameras installed.
In 2018, Voilland contended that the courts and county had historically failed to provide funding for the obligation to conduct home studies in child custody cases.
Unable to resolve the situation within the county, Voiland escalated his complaints to the state level.
In 2019, Malloy removed 234,000 voters from the statewide rolls, ruling that state law compelled him to do so.
The League of Women Voters, to whom Malloy refused to grant standing to intervene in the case, The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which was also denied standing by Malloy, has also filed suit in federal court to halt the contested purging.
Wisconsin's Attorney General Josh Kaul also file a notice of appeal to halt the purging, acting on behalf of the state's Elections Commission and requesting to stay of Malloy's order.
The issue was brought before the court by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL).
The Institute is a right-wing organization mostly supported by the Bradley Foundation, which funds such political causes.
The lawsuit demanded that the Wisconsin Election Commission respond to a "Movers Report," generated from voter data analysis produced by the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a national, non-partisan partnership funded in 2012 by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
ERIC shares voter registration information to improve the accuracy of voter rolls.
The report tagged 234,039 voters who may have moved to an address that had not yet been updated on their voter registration forms.
Despite thin evidence for removal of that extraordinary number of qualified voters, Wisconsin may be forced to comply with Malloy's order.
On January 2, 2010, WILL said it asked the circuit court to hold the Elections Commission in contempt, fining it up to $12,000 daily, until it advances Malloy’s December 17, 2019 order to purge from the voting rolls hundreds of thousands of registered voters who possibly have moved to a different address.
The case being litigated in a state appeals court, but it was thought that the conservative-dominated Wisconsin Supreme Court would be likely to hear it.
Ozaukee County is heavily Republican, having voted for a Democratic presidential candidate only once after 1936 when it voted for Lyndon Johnson in 1964.
The purge was felt to be targeting voters living in the cities of Madison, and Milwaukee, and college towns, which all exhibit Democratic voting strength.
Two of the three plaintiffs in the case heard by Malloy were significant contributors to state Republican party candidates' campaigns, including former state representative and senator, David W. Opitz.
Disenfranchisement expert Greg Palast ties the Wisconsin effort at voter purging as part of a national Republican strategy.
Barrage de Portage-des-Roches
The Portage-des-Roches dam ("Portage-des-Roches being the translation of the Montagnais" "Ashini Kushnapagan") or " Taschereau Dam" (in honor of "Louis-Alexandre Taschereau") is a dam located in the Laterrière sector of borough Chicoutimi, at Saguenay (city), Quebec, Canada.
The largest water retaining structure in Kenogami Lake, this dam constitutes the source of the Chicoutimi River, whose flow is totally dependent on it.
Portage-des-Roches is located at confluence between Chicoutimi River and the eastern end of Kénogami Reservoir.
This natural corridor carved out by glaciation is a depression located between the elevation of Lac Jean-Deschênes that of the southern valley of the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean or Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
As part of the main portage suite which links the Saguenay to Lac Saint-Jean, by Kenogami Lake and Chicoutimi River, Portage-des-Roches was borrowed by Father Jean Dequen in 1652.
In 1732, it was the surveyor Joseph-Laurent Normandin, who translated the Montagnais term "Ashini Kushnapagan" into "Portage-des-Roches".
In 2010, the Government of Quebec issued a call for tenders to improve the evacuation capacity of the spillway, raise the crest of the dam and replace wooden valves with steel valves with an independent system that can be controlled remotely.
The various works take account of the technical recommendations contained in the report of the Nicolet Commission.
The total cost of the rehabilitation project is estimated at $ 50 million.
The work must be completed in 2013.

RTE Studio bombing
The RTE Studio bombing was a bomb attack carried out by the Ulster Loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in Dublin, Ireland.
It was the first Loyalist bombing in the Republic of Ireland during The Troubles.
In March and April 1969 the UVF and Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) carried out a number of sabotage bombings and blamed them on the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
The attack took place on 5 August 1969 at 1:30 am.
The blast could be heard over a wide area of Dublin city, nobody was injured.
The bomb is believed to have been planted at the rear wall of the studio building and not much structural damage was done to the building, accept for the shattering of glass panels.
Later that morning all Irish daily newspapers had front-page coverage of the blast.
This was the start of a Loyalist campaign of bombings in the Republic of Ireland that would continue until the mid 1970s, with the deadliest being the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which killed 34.
On 19 October 1969, UVF & UPV member Thomas "Tommy" McDowell was electrocuted while planting a bomb at an electricity sub-station in Ballyshannon, County Donegal.
He died of his injuries three days later.
On 24 October, the UVF claimed responsibility for both the Ballyshannon and the RTÉ bombing.
The statement read "the attempted attack was a protest against the Irish Army units still massed on the border in Co Donegal".
The statement added: "so long as the threats from Éire continue, so long will the volunteers of Ulster's people's army strike at targets in Southern Ireland".
Until then the Irish security forces believed the RTE bombing was the work of Irish republicans who had a grudge against RTE.
The UVF carried out two more bomb attacks in the Republic that year: on the Wolfe Tone memorial in Bodenstown, County Kildare on 31 October, and on 26 December on the Daniel O'Connell monument in Dublin.
Six months after the RTE bombing the UVF struck again at RTE.
On 18 February 1970 it bombed a 240-foot radio mast on Mongary Hill, near Raphoe, County Donegal, putting the transmitter out of action.
The mast had allowed RTE radio signals to be broadcast into Northern Ireland.
The UVF claimed responsibility the next day.
UVF sabotage bombings continued sporadically in the Republic throughout 1970 and 1971.
Beautiful People (Big Country song)
"Beautiful People" is a song by Scottish rock band Big Country, released in 1991 as the second and final single from their fifth studio album "No Place Like Home".
It was written by Stuart Adamson and produced by Pat Moran.
"Beautiful People" reached No.
72 on the UK Singles Chart, and No.
36 on the BBC's Heavy Metal/Rock chart.
The song's music video was directed by Roger Pomphrey and shot at Peckham, London.
Speaking to the Big Country fanzine "Inwards" in 1991, Adamson said of the song: "This is about how you can find cool things in the most fucked-up places."
Upon release, Peter Kinghorn of "Newcastle Evening Chronicle" described "Beautiful People" as a "gently rolling singalong tune" with "plinking banjo and piano".
Craig McLean of "Vox" felt the song's piano "honks and tonks agreeably".
Steve Stewart of "The Press and Journal" considered "No Place Like Home" to present "a different style of music" from Big Country.
He commented: "There is a slower, more relaxed feel to their sound, as displayed in "Beautiful People"."
In a review of one of the band's 1991 concerts, David Sinclair of "The Times" noted the song's "honky-tonk piano, mandolin and mellow sentiments".
John Peel, reviewing the single for "New Musical Express", commented: "It sounds like Mungo Jerry.
My dad would have described it as half-baked piffle and he'd have been right.
Sorry, Stuart."
In a retrospective review of the single, JT Griffith of AllMusic felt "Return to the Two Headed King" and "Fly Like An Eagle" were "unimpressive", with "Beautiful People" being "by far [the] strongest song".

Hocquart Lake
The lac Hocquart is a freswater body crossed by the Pika River on the watershed of the Pikauba River and the Saguenay River.
Lac Hocquart is located in the unorganized territory of Lac-Achouakan, in the Lac-Saint-Jean-Est Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
This lake is located in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
This small valley is served indirectly by the route 169 and a few secondary routes for forestry, recreational tourism activities.
Forestry is the main economic activity in the sector; recreotourism activities, in second.
The surface of Lake Hocquart is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, but safe circulation on the ice is generally made from mid-December to mid-March.
The main watersheds near Lake Hocquart are:
Hocquart Lake is in the shape of a pallet hat, a width of and an altitude of .
This lake is mainly fed by the Pika River (coming from the west), by the Gobeil stream (coming from the east) and by the outlet (coming from the south) of Lac Larivière.
The mouth of this lake is located at:
From the mouth of Lake Hocquart, the current follows the course of the Pika River consecutively on to the north, the course of the Pikauba River on north to the confluence with Kenogami Lake; it crosses this lake on north-east to Barrage de Portage-des-Roches; the course of the Chicoutimi River on to the east, then the northeast and the course of the Saguenay River on east to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.
This toponym evokes the life work of Gilles Hocquart (1694-1783), born in Mortagne-au-Perche (France).
After having been controller of the port of Rochefort, he came in 1729 to settle in Quebec (city), as authorizing commissioner and interim intendant of New France, in order to replace Claude -Thomas Dupuy; he was confirmed in his functions in 1731.
In about twenty years, Gilles Hocquart advanced settlement and agriculture, notably by granting seigneuries in the region of lac Champlain and in Nouvelle-Beauce.
He ensured the completion of chemin du Roi, on the left bank of St. Lawrence River, in addition to encouraging shipbuilding, export development, industrial production at Forges du Saint-Maurice, while maintaining a fairly good balance in public finances.
Returning to France in 1748, he was first, until 1763, steward of the port of Brest and, as such, he remained in contact with the colony by helping several Acadians deported to establishing themselves in France and ensuring the fitting out of ships bound for Quebec (city) during the Seven Years' War.
Gilles Hocquart was appointed State Councilor in 1764 and, until his death, he was entrusted with the stewardship of the Navy classes.
One of his main achievements was the construction of a depot at the Intendant's palace in Quebec (city), where all of the colony's timed registers and documents are stored.
Despite the refusal of the king of France, Gilles Hocquart arranged for this place to keep the official documents of the colony in a safe place.
Several historians of French Canada emphasize that his stubbornness in front of the king would have made it possible to preserve a substantial part of the archives written in the XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries.
The toponym "Lac Hocquart" was formalized on December 5, 1968 by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

A Rubber Band Christmas
A Rubber Band Christmas is a 1996 instrumental Christmas novelty album featuring traditional and popular Christmas songs played entirely on rubber bands, staplers and other office equipment.
The album is noted for its comic effects and has been described as one of the "weirdest" and most novel releases of its type.
The album came about when two artists, Jeff St. Pierre and Philip Antoniades, found themselves bored one evening at the office and began creating Christmas music out of rubber bands, staplers, tape and other office supplies to hand.
After entertaining themselves through the night with this diversion, they forwarded the results as a "seasonal thank you" to friends and associates.
The recording was sufficiently well received that Artist Development Associates of Framingham, Massachusetts, decided to release it as a CD, under the title "A Rubber Band Christmas", with St. Pierre and Antoniades going by the name "The Rubberband Band".
The CD was re-released on October 24, 2000.
The album's fourteen tracks typically feature a rubber band twanging out the melody, while a ruler struck at different lengths adds a bass accompaniment.
Rhythm is sometimes supplied through the use of "quickly-yanked frosty tape".
The tracks featured are a selection of traditional and popular Christmas carols and ballads, with the word "rubber" substituted at some point in the title, yielding names such as "Rubber Bells" (for Jingle Bells), "Rudolph the Rubber-nosed Reindeer" (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer) and "Feliz Rubberdad" (Feliz Navidad) etc.
"AllMusic" states that in spite of the unusual instrumentation, the tracks are "still recognizable as—and a whole lot sillier than—the original carols."
The reviewer concludes that while the 14 tracks "may be too much of a good thing", the release constitutes "easily the most novel holiday novelty album in a long while.
It must be heard to be believed."
Scott Frampton of "CMJ New Music Monthly" wrote that the album would have strong appeal to "aficionados of the pop-culturally weird".
Kyle Brown of "Rubber and Plastic News" wrote that "The snaps and twangs aren't always pitch-perfect, but a lot of spirit comes through.
Even the off notes sometimes sound catchy in new and interesting ways."
Canadian broadcaster and columnist MC Gilles included the album at number three in a list of his five top Christmas novelty albums, describing it as "unbearable, but nice."
Brian Boyd of the "Irish Times" included the album at number four on a list of "5 weirdest albums of all time", describing it as "a unique listening experience ...
Criminally out of print, it can only be listened to in [short] intervals" but "you sort of want it in your collection all the same."
Tracks from the album have been featured on both the BBC and on the ABC's Radio National websites, the latter in a "Christmas surprise cracker."

Timeline of the Syrian Civil War (September–December 2019)
The following is a timeline of the Syrian Civil War from September–December 2019.
Information about aggregated casualty counts is found at Casualties of the Syrian Civil War.
In October 2019, Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring amid a U.S. withdrawal.
In response to the Turkish offensive, Russia arranged for negotiations between the Syrian government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led forces.
Russia also negotiated a renewal of a cease-fire between Kurds and Turkey that was about to expire.
The US withdrawal caused major policy debate amongst US officials.
Some officials asserted that they had advised the Kurds for some time to reach some understanding with Turkey.
“We did not give a military guarantee to the Kurds against Turkey...” said James Jeffrey at a hearing on Oct. 22.
“In fact, much of our conversations with the Kurds [was] that you had to find some kind of political accommodation with Turkey because you couldn’t count on us to keep the Turks out militarily.”
Amid the Turkish offensive and U.S. withdrawal, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander-in-chief Mazloum Abdi announced that they were ready to partner with Russia and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian government, stating that "... if we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people."
According to Syrian Kurdish officials, the deal allowed Syrian government forces to take over security in some border areas, but their own administration would maintain control of local institutions.
Syrian troops entered some key towns in northeastern Syria, including Manbij, Tell Tamer, Kobanî, and Ayn Issa, and took up position in some areas to oppose Turkish troops that were threatening various Kurdish forces.
The developments led to Kurdish concern that the independence of their declared Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES) in Rojava might be severely curtailed.
On 15 October, Russian forces began patrolling along the contact line between Turkish and Syrian government forces in northeast Syria, filling the security vacuum created by the sudden U.S. withdrawal.
Video footage showed Russian soldiers and journalists touring a base that the U.S. left behind.
Alexander Lavrentiev, Russia's special envoy on Syria, warned that the Turkish offensive into Syria was unacceptable and stated that Russia was seeking to prevent conflict between Turkish and Syrian troops.
Russia and Turkey made an agreement via the Sochi Agreement of 2019 to set up a Second Northern Syria Buffer Zone.
Syrian President Assad expressed full support for the deal, as various terms of the agreement also applied to the Syrian government.
Following the creation of the Second Northern Syria Buffer Zone the SDF stated that it was ready to merge with the Syrian Army if when a political settlement between the Syrian government and the SDF is achieved.
The Syrian Democratic Council said it was ready to have positive discussions with the Assad government.
They said their focus would shift to stopping the Turkish invasion.
On 30 October, the recently-negotiated Syrian Constitutional Committee held its inaugural meeting.
In November 2019, refugees in Northeast Syria reported they had received no help from international aid organizations.
On 20 November 2019, a new Syrian Constitutional Committee, with about 150 members, began discussing a new settlement and to draft a new constitution for Syria.
The committee includes representatives of the Syrian government, opposition groups, and countries serving as guarantors of the process such as Russia.
However, this committee has faced strong opposition from the Syrian government.
50 of the committee members represent the Assad government, and 50 members represent the opposition.
The committee began working in November 2019 in Geneva, under UN auspices.
However, the Syrian government delegation left on the second day of the process.
On 24 November, pro-government forces launched a new Idlib offensive, the largest offensive by the Syrian government in Idlib in more than three months.
Russia and Syria escalated their attacks against rebel forces in Idlib.
This was criticized by the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning against violence against civilians in Idlib.
A new international issue emerged when Syrian forces reached the area of various Turkish outposts, and Erdogan said that Turkish forces would not withdraw from any position.
Syrian troops closed in on the town of Maaret al-Numan.
On December 30, 2019, the US launched air strikes in Syria against rebel groups allied with Iran.
It appeared that Turkey was withdrawing all of its forces away from the al-Shirkark silos, which hold important supplies of wheat, this seemed to be a result of Russian mediation.
However, some reports said they later returned to re-occupy that area.
Russia said it would pledge to remove Turkish forces from a key highway in northern Syria, and replace them with Russian forces to maintain stability.
Russian and Turkish forces are continuing their joint patrols.
Questions remained about how much control Turkey has over its proxies, such as the Free Syrian Army.
Turkey has begun to appoint local mayors and governors in several northern Syrian towns.
They have also appointed about 4,000 police officers and other local officials, and are providing some basic local services for citizens.
There are some reports that Turkey has become more involved with local infrastructure in areas that it controls.
Some local schools have been provided with some teachers and curriculum components.
Erdogan said that Turkey expects to resettle about 1 million refugees in that a rea, and called for more support from the EU and from world organizations.
Some protesters in Syria blamed Turkey for the latest Syrian attacks on Idlib.
They claim that the rebel groups posted near Idlib are largely akin to mercenary groups answering to Turkey.
It is unclear whether there is strong evidence for this allegation.
Meanwhile, as Turkey considers sending some elements of these groups to Libya, it heightens such allegations.
A major statement from NGO ACT Alliance found that millions of Syrian refugees remain displaced in countries around Syria.
this includes around 1.5 million refugees in Lebanon.
Also the report found that refugees in camps in north-eastern Syria have tripled this year.
The UNHCR has also been tracking data on refugees, and maintains an official website to do so.
Numerous refugees remain in local refugee camps.
Conditions there are reported to be severe, especially with winter approaching.
4,000 people are housed at the Washokani Camp.
No organizations are assisting them other than the Kurdish Red Cross.
Numerous camp residents have called for assistance from international groups.
Over 120,000 refugees were reported fleeing Idlib governorate.
In December 2019, Erdogan stated that Syrian bombing of Idlib had caused new waves of refugees to enter Turkey,also stated that Turkey could not handle this new influx, and that this influx would be "be "felt by all European countries".
The UN said 235,0000 refugees have fled the area.
Turkey is reaching out to Russia to try to mitigate the situation.
Erdogan said he would ask for Russia's help in limiting the new wave of refugees.
The Syrian Army is continuing to attack, with Russian air support.
Erdogan said that Turkey expects to resettle about 1 million refugees in the "buffer zone" that it controls.
Erdogan claimed that Turkey had spent billions on approximately five million refugees now being housed in Turkey; and called for more funding from wealthier nations and from the EU.
This plan raised concerns among Kurds about displacement of existing communities and groups in that area.
SDF Commander Mazlum Abdi called on the US and Russia to help stop Turkey from displacing entire communities and ethnic groups from the areas that it controls.
Erdogan stated that Turkey was ready to resettle the Syrian refugees in the northern area that Turkey had invaded, and that Turkey would pay for it if necessary.
On 9 December 2019, various local accounts indicated that Turkey was moving Syrian refugees into its zone of operations in Northern Syria for the first time.
Erdogan said that Turkey was working to settle one million people in the cities of Tal Abyad and Ras Al-Ain in northern Syria.
This has led to fears of population change Erdogan claimed that Turkey had spent billions on approximately five million refugees now being housed in Turkey; and also asserted that wealthier nations had done little to address the situation.
This issue caused discussion in Turkish society.
In December 2019, Erdogan stated that Syrian bombing of Idlib had caused new waves of refugees to enter Turkey.
Erdogan stated that Turkey could not handle this new influx, and that this influx would be "be "felt by all European countries".
On December 30, 2019, over 50 Syrian refugees, including 27 children, were welcomed in Ireland, where they started afresh in their new temporary homes at the Mosney Accommodation Centre in Co Meath.
The migrant refugees were pre-interviewed by Irish officials under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).
As of December 2019, a diplomatic dispute is occurring at the UN over re-authorization of cross-border aid for refugees.
China and Russia oppose the draft resolution that seeks to re-authorize crossing points in Turkey, Iraq, and Jordan; China and Russia, as allies of Assad, seek to close the two crossing points in Iraq and Jordan, and to leave only the two crossing points in Turkey active.
All of the ten individuals representing the non-permanent members of the Security Council stood in the corridor outside of the chamber speaking to the press to state that all four crossing points are crucial and must be renewed.
United Nations official Mark Lowcock is asking the UN to re-authorize cross-border aid to enable aid to continue to reach refugees in Syria.
He says there is no other way to deliver the aid that is needed.
He noted that four million refugees out of the over eleven million refugees who need assistance are being reached through four specific international crossing points.
Lowcock serves as the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.<ref name="UN VOA 12/2019">Margaret Besheer (18 December 2019), "UN: Ability to Get Lifesaving Aid to 4 Million Syrians at Risk".</ref>
Russia, aided by China's support, has vetoed the resolution to retain all four border crossings.
An alternate resolution also did not pass.
The US strongly criticized the vetoes and opposition by Russia and China.
The US Ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, said this opposition to these crossings would be "disastrous."
An official statement by the US Government on the State Department website stated this veto was "shameful."
Erdogan said that Turkey expects to resettle about 1 million refugees in the "buffer zone" that it controls.
Erdogan claimed that Turkey had spent billions on approximately five million refugees now being housed in Turkey; and called for more funding from wealthier nations and from the EU.
This plan raised concerns among Kurds about displacement of existing communities and groups in that area.
Russia is taking a leading role in assisting with efforts to rebuild infrastructure in Syria.
In addition to efforts by the Russian government, several Russian companies have begun to take leading roles in economic rebuilding projects as well.
In general positive negotiations have increased between Syria and Turkey, and between Syria and Kurdish groups.
On the ground, Turkish areas of operations had been delineated by Russian mediators.
Russian military officials forged agreements between Syria, Turkey and Kurds for areas to be patrolled by each side.
Russia handles security through its own forces deployed in some key towns.
On 9 December, Russian troops entered Raqqa and began distributing humanitarian aid.
As a result of the Turkish incursion, multiple Kurdish groups that were once rivals have begun to seek greater unity.
Additionally, Syrian Kurdish officials have had some positive discussions with the Assad government, and with local countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE and Jordan.
Various Kurdish faction that were historical rivals began to meet in order to work together more.
Their stated reason was to stand together against Russia and Turkey more strongly if needed.
The Russian government has informed the Kurdish factions that they should reconcile and come up with a unified set of demands to clarify to Russia.
Various Kurdish factions blamed each other and their council for lack of progress.
The national Syrian government sent representatives to northeast Syria to meet with local groups there in order to address their concerns and to emphasize unity and combined effort to address problems.
A meeting occurred in Qamishli city, in northeast Syria, that included Syrian national officials, and delegates from Kurdish, Arab, and Syrian figures and forces.
Kurdish delegates emphasized their desire to help to protect Syria as a whole.
They expressed willingness to have positive discussions with the Assad government.
Some reports indicated that meetings between officials of the Assad government and leaders of local political factions went well, and all parties agreed on common goals to improve Syrian society as a whole.
The SDF has shown some reluctance to integrate into the Syrian National Army as requested by the Assad government, though.
Luqman Ehmê, spokesman for the North East Syria Autonomous Administration, said that his organization was ready for positive discussions with the Syrian regime.
SDF General Commander Mazlum Abdi has met with local leaders of the Wise Committee, which is composed of leaders of local communities and local family groupings.
This meeting emphasized the importance on national unity, and the need to stand against Turkish invaders.
The M4 road to Aleppo was set to reopen, based on an agreement mediated by Russia with Turkey, Turkey's allies in Syria, and the SDF.
It was reported that the Russian and Turkish armies had made a deal whereby electricity would be supplied to Tal Abyad by Russia's allies, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who now support Assad; while water would be supplied by the Alouk water station that is controlled by Turkish forces.
This deal was mainly facilitated by Russian military officials.
On 12 December 2019, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that Turkey's northern buffer zone had now "stabilized" the situation in northern Syria.
At a panel discussion on the conflict in December 2019, several experts said the conflict was slowly moving towards resolution.
One expert said that the "Astana" diplomatic process, involving Turkey, Russia, and Iran, was having some positive results.
Experts also said that Bashar Assad had made progress in restoring rule by local councils in areas affected by the conflict.
In December 2019, the EU held an international conference which condemned any suppression of the Kurds, and called for the self-declared Automnomous Administration in Rojava to be preserved and to be reflected in any new Syrian Constitution.
The Kurds are concerned that the independence of their declared Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES) in Rojava might be severely curtailed.
The United States announced it will pass major new sanctions against Syria and Russia, as well as Iran, reportedly due to alleged war crimes committed during the civil war.
The US Congress has enacted punitive sanctions on the Syrian government for its actions during the Civil War.
These sanctions would penalize any entities lending support to the Syrian government, and any companies operating in Syria.
US President Donald Trump tried to protect the Turkish President Erdogan from the effect of such sanctions.
Some activists welcomed this legislation.
Some critics noted that these punitive sanctions are likely to backfire or have unintended consequences; i.e., instead of impeding or curtailing the Syrian government, it will increase its authority, as ordinary Syrian people will now have less economic resources due to these sanctions, and will need to rely on the Syrian government and its economic allies and projects even more.
Critics said that such economic sanctions have little realistic chance of promoting real reform and democracy; their impact on the political ruling class will be limited, while they will likely affect ordinary Syrians disproportionately.
Mohammed al-Abdallah, Executive Director of Syria Justice and Accountability Center (SJAC), said that the sanctions will likely hurt ordinary Syrian people, saying, “it is an almost unsolvable unfeasible equation.
If they are imposed, they will indirectly harm the Syrian people, and if they are lifted, they will indirectly revive the Syrian regime;” he attributed the sanctions to “political considerations, as the United States does not have weapons and tools in the Syrian file, and sanctions are its only means.”
Peter Ford, the former UK Ambassador to Syria, said "...going forward, we’re seeing more economic warfare.
It seems that the US, having failed to change the regime in Syria by military force or by proxies, is tightening the economic screws and the main reason why the US is keeping hold of the production facilities in eastern Syria.
So, the economic situation is becoming more and more serious and dire in Syria and it’s a major reason why refugees are not going back.”
In the Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration in Northern and Eastern Syrian (NES) of Rojava, Kurdish opposition parties have refused to re-open their offices.
they have cited a lack of trust in the regional government of Rojava.
Meanwhile, officials of the NES held meetings with local Arab leaders, who stated that Kurdish forces are unfairly detaining women and children from their communities.
At the NATO summit in London in December 2019, President Emmanuel Macron of France highlighted major differences with Turkey over the definition of terrorism, and said there was little chance this aspect of the conflict could be resolved positively.
Macron criticized Turkey strongly for fighting against groups who had been allied with France and the West in fighting terrorism.
Numerous issues in resolving the conflict emerged at the NATO summit in London.
Turkey proposed a safe zone where Syrian refugees could be relocated, but this idea did not receive support from all parties.
Prior to the NATO Summit, there was a meeting at 10 Downing Street of the leaders of France, the UK, Germany and Turkey.
One key point that emerged that the Western countries insisted that refugees could only be relocated voluntarily.

Apica River
The Apica River is a freshwater tributary of the Pikauba River, flowing in the unorganized territory of Lac-Ministuk, in the Le Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
The Apica River flows through a narrow, steep valley.
Visitors can admire the panorama from a rest area located a few kilometers north of the route 169 bridge over it.
This river turns out to be the outlet of a series of small aligned lakes, located to the south, Lake Micoine constituting its head.
At the end of the route, the Apica river flows at the foot of Apica mountain, culminating at .
The lake of the same name is located to the southwest of Mount-Apica; however, this lake is integrated into the watershed of the rivière aux Écorces.
The upper part of the Apica valley is accessible by the route 169 (route d'Iberville); other secondary forest roads have been developed in the sector for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
Forestry is the primary economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second.
The surface of the Apica River is usually frozen from late November to early April, however safe circulation on the ice is generally from mid-December to late March.
The Apica River intersects the route 169 connecting Quebec (city) to Lac Saint-Jean, halfway between Jacques-Cartier Lake and the northwest limit of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
The main watersheds adjacent to the Apica River are:
The Apica River rises at the mouth of Lake Micoine (altitude: ).
The mouth which is on the north shore of this head lake is located at:
From the mouth of Lake Micoine, the course of the Apica River flows over entirely in the forest zone, with a drop of , according to the following segments :
The Apica river flows on the west bank of the Pikauba River.
This confluence is located at:
From the confluence of the Apica river with the Pikauba River, the current descends successively the Pikauba river on to the northeast, then the current crosses the Kenogami Lake on north-east to Barrage de Portage-des-Roches, then follows the course of the Chicoutimi River on to the east, then the northeast, and the course of the Saguenay River on east to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.
The Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec (1914 and 1925) calls this stream "Upika River".
The toponymic designation of this river appears under the spelling "Upica" on the map of the province of Quebec by Eugène Taché (1870), in Studies by Stanislas Drapeau on the developments of the colonization of Lower Canada (1863), and in an 1850 report from the Commissioner of Crown Lands, JH Price, with the spelling "Upika".
The Innu term "upica" means "it is constricted" when speaking of a watercourse.
This term could also mean "carrying strap", according to an interpretation known formerly.
Long used, the name "Upica" was changed in 1961 to "Apica" as was the new designation "Mount Apica".
This mountain then acquired a certain notoriety following the installation, nearby, of a radar station, today disused.
The toponym "Apica river" was formalized on June 6, 1973 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church
St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church in Wake Forest, North Carolina, a suburb of Raleigh.
The first Catholics to settle in Wake Forest were George Bolus and his wife in 1910.
Soon after, the Wilkinson family moved to the area from New Orleans, becoming the second Catholic family in the town.
Catholics who soon after settled in the town had to travel to Raleigh to attend mass.
As more Catholics settled in the area, a traveling priest John A. Beshel, the Chaplain of the Nazareth Orphanage, occasionally celebrated mass in the living room of the home of the Bolus family, using a closet as a confessional.
In 1938 St. Peter's Chapel, a Railroad chapel car built by the Catholic Extension Society of Chicago in 1892, was given to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh to use as a house of worship for Catholics in Wake Forest.
The train car, which included a bedroom and kitchen for the priest, an altar, and sixty seats for congregants, was parked at the Seaboard Railroad by Bishop Eugene J. McGuinness, and was used until February of 1940.
In the 1930s Biship McGuinness' cousin, the papal countess Katherine E. Price, visited Wake Forest and was surprised that the college town did not have a Catholic Church.
She donated a large amount of money for the construction of a church and rectory.
A plot of land was purchased at 701 South Main Street and construction began in 1939.
The architect for the original church was Frank Frimmer of Tampa, Florida.
The Gothic church was built using granite from the nearby town of Rolesville.
The church was dedicated by Bishop McGuinness on February 25, 1940 and named after Catherine of Siena, the patron saint of Price.
In 1947 Father Tevlin, the priest at St. Catherine's, built St. Eugene's Church in Wendell as a daughter parish.
In 1948 John Hyland succeeded Tevlin as priest of St. Catherine's and St. Eugene's.
Hyland, who was the first superior of Bishop Vincent Stanislaus Waters' Missionary Apostolate.
He made Wake Forest the headquarters of the Missionary Fathers from a mobile trailer-chapel called Madonna of the Highways, located near St. Catherine's.
The trailer was dedicated on May 6, 1948 by the Apostolic Delegate Amleto Giovanni Cicognani at the annual convention of the North Carolina Catholic Laymen Association in Wilmington.
On August 14, 1966 a transport tractor trailer struck a power pole and trees along the front side of the church.
A large marble statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was knocked into the church, destroying part of the south wall, foundation, and interior of part of the church.
On September 4, 1977, the parish rectory caught on fire.
On August 27, 1979 lightning struck the church bell tower, severely damaging it.
In May 1987 the pastoral administrative duties were granted to Sister Joanne DiGiovanni of the Sisters of Mercy until a new priest was hired in July of that year.
In 1988 the church purchased 18.625 acres of land near West Holding Avenue for $172,212.50 in order to build a larger facility.
In 1997, new buildings were built on the plot on West Holding, including a parochial school.
In 1999 St. Catherine's founded its second daughter parish, Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church in Louisburg.
In 2001 St. Catherine's purchased over 20 acres of land west of new property for $800,000, building a new school buildings.
In 2009 the church hired the architect Jim O’Brien and Clancy & Theys construction company to build a 33,000 square foot church in the Romanesque style, with seating for 1,700 people.
The new church cost $9 million to build.

2020 Chilean Primera División
The 2020 Campeonato Nacional, known as Campeonato Nacional AFP PlanVital 2020 for sponsorship reasons, is the 90th season of top-flight football in Chile.
The season started on 24 January 2020.
Universidad Católica are the defending champions, having won the previous tournament.
For this season, and given that the previous season was declared as concluded with no relegations to the Primera B, the Asociación Nacional de Fútbol Profesional (ANFP) approved an expansion of the first tier to 18 teams, with two teams promoted from the second tier joining the 16 teams that competed in the top flight in 2019.
The 18 teams will play each other twice (once at home and once away) for a total of 34 matches.
Qualification for the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana will be awarded to the top seven teams at the end of the season, as well as the Copa Chile champions who will qualify for the Copa Libertadores.
Since there were no relegated teams in the previous season, in this season three teams will be relegated to the second tier: the last-placed team in the standings of the 2020 season, the last-placed team in a relegation table which will be elaborated considering the performance in both the 2019 and 2020 seasons, and the losers of a play-off between the teams placed second-to-last of both tables.
Eighteen teams will take part in the league in this season: the sixteen teams from the previous season, plus the 2019 Primera B champions Santiago Wanderers and Deportes La Serena, winners of the Primera B promotion play-offs.
For this season, a weighted table will be elaborated by computing an average of the points earned per game over this season and the previous one, with the average of points earned in the 2019 season weighted by 60% and the average of points earned in the 2020 season weighted by 40%.
Promoted teams will only have their points in the 2020 season averaged, without weighting.
The team placed last in this table at the end of the season will be relegated, while the team placed second-to-last will qualify for the relegation play-off.

Yummy (Justin Bieber song)
"Yummy" is a song by Canadian singer Justin Bieber.
It was released on January 3, 2020, along with a lyric video through Def Jam Recordings as the lead single from his upcoming fifth studio album, "Changes".
The song is Bieber's first solo single to be released in three years.
Bieber notably joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok on the day of the song's release.
The song received mixed reviews from music critics, with some praising the song's R&B sound, but dismissing the lyrics.
Bieber received criticism for the song's "excessive promotion".
The song debuted at number two on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, while reaching the top five in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and various other countries; and hitting number one only in New Zealand.
The song's official music video was released on January 4, 2020.
On December 23, 2019, Bieber teased the release by posting a picture of himself in front of a piano accompanied by two posts with the caption "tomorrow".
On the following day, he announced the single via a trailer he uploaded to YouTube that shows him walking through an abandoned gas station.
The trailer also serves as an announcement for his upcoming North American tour starting May 14, 2020, as well as a documentary covering "all different stories".
About the upcoming music, Bieber stated that he feels like "this is different than the previous albums just because of where I'm at in my life".
On the release day of "Yummy", Bieber joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok and posted a video of himself lip-syncing to the song, and encouraged his fans to do so, as well.
Four days later, Bieber released autographed limited editions of "Yummy", including a cassette, a seven-inch picture disc, six unique CDs and five unique seven-inch vinyl discs, available for only 24 hours.
Bieber released five additional music videos for the song, titled: "Animated Version", "x drew house, Animated Version", "Beliebers React", "Fan Lip Sync" and "Food Fight", and launched an official "Yummy" online game.
"Yummy" is a "straightforward R&B number" that moves along on pop-trap beats.
The song contains a "crisp bass line and plinking keyboards".
Bieber rap-sings the pre-chorus, while he hits his "signature falsetto" in the bridge.
Bryan Rolli of "Forbes" magazine called the chorus "seductive", albeit "meaningless".
The song is considered an ode to Bieber's wife, Hailey Bieber.
In an exclusive interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Bieber admitted that Yummy is about his sex life.
The song received mixed reviews from music critics.
Rania Aniftos of "Billboard" magazine said "Yummy" brings back "the flirtatious Bieber we've missed and been waiting for", describing the chorus as "catchy".
Bryan Rolli, writing for "Forbes", said that Bieber "sings his heart out" on the song and noted although "the lyrics may not invite scholarly analysis ... Bieber sure does sound good singing them".
Rolli concluded calling the song a "win, an inevitable chart smash" and opined that it is "sure to sound even better when 50,000 fans scream it every night on his upcoming tour".
Mikael Wood of "Los Angeles Times" described the song as "a lithe little R&B number that faintly recalls Ginuwine's mid-'90s classic 'Pony' and basically three-and-a-half minutes of PG-13 sex talk seemingly directed at Hailey Baldwin".
He stated that "though it's very cute, 'Yummy' feels awfully lightweight for a single that has as much hanging on it as this one does" and added that the song "loses much of its flavor after only a few spins".
Brad Callas of "Complex" magazine listed "Yummy" amongst the best new music of the week and said Bieber's "pivot back to R&B is refreshing for those who were fans of his slept-on 2013 project, "Journals"".
Callas further remarked that the "silky vocals" is at times reminiscent of Bieber's 2016 collaboration with Post Malone, "Deja Vu".
"NME"s Sam Moore complimented the song's R&B production, but dismissed the lyrics, which he termed as "failed expectations".
He opined that the song's producers opted for "minimalism with their choice of instrumentation, melding airy keys with pop-trap beats with an evident view of creating something as universal as the likes of 'Hotline Bling' and Childish Gambino's 'Feels Like Summer'".
Moore further wrote that Bieber's layered vocals and harmonies are "able to glide along rather effortlessly—it's just a shame he doesn't have more to say with them" and that Bieber's embrace of R&B "isn't a complete turn-off".
"Pitchfork"s Eric Torres criticized the song for being "shamelessly engineered for the truncated attention span of TikTok" and "a bloodless shell of an R&B song crippled by asinine lyrics and a tired, syncopated backdrop".
He further wrote that the song "plateaus as soon as it starts, never inching past the toddler-like repetition of 'yummy-yum' in its chorus".
The Guardian's Alexis Petridis wrote that "Yummy" is "eager to go viral" on TikTok, comparing it to viral songs on the lip-syncing app such as Arizona Zervas's "Roxanne", Ashnikko's "Stupid" and Regard's "Ride It", and that "a generation grown on highly sophisticated, multilayered internet culture can detect bullshit a mile off: this is so nakedly eager to go viral that it almost certainly won't."
Petridis pointed out the "shameless plug for his streetwear brand Drew House", "the cringeworthy use of trap ebonics", "use of baby talk to vaguely gesture at a world of sexual pleasure" and the "chorus seems designed purely for Gen Z-ers in yoga pants to spoon frozen acai into their mouths while miming along to the word 'yummy'".
He concluded by stating Bieber "doesn't need the TikTok virality, but craves its pop-cultural relevance – and that desperation chafes awkwardly against the spiritually grounded marital bliss of his current image".
The music video for "Yummy" was directed by Bardia Zeinali and premiered on January 4, 2020.
In the video, it portrays Bieber with pink hair at a dinner party in a fancy restaurant, eating various colorful food items with the guests.
The video garnered 8.4 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming his second biggest 24-hour debut on the platform out of his 5 lead singles.
In the United States, "Yummy" debuted at number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, blocked from the top spot by Roddy Ricch's "The Box", becoming Bieber's second consecutive single as a lead artist to debut at the second spot, following "I Don't Care", which was blocked from the top set by "Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus.. "Yummy" proceeded to fall to number ten the following week.
On the UK Singles Chart, the track debuted at number five, becoming his first lead single to not debut in the top 3 of the chart since "One Time" the lead single from his debut EP, My World.
"Yummy" also debuted in the top 10 in Ireland, where it landed at number 8, as well as number 16 in Scotland.
It also debuted in the top 20 of other European countries, going number 7 in the Netherlands, number 10 in Italy and number 15 in Germany.
In Oceania, the song debuted at number 8 in Australia, peaking at number 4.
In New Zealand, it topped the singles chart in its second week.
Bieber received criticism for his "excessive" promotion of "Yummy" during the song's release week, that included release of autographed CD variants, seven different videos for the song, launching an official "Yummy" game, online fan interactions that involved Bieber asking fans to buy the song and Bieber's manager Scooter Braun encouraging fans to mass-purchase the song.
Bieber received backlash for manipulation of streaming services, with many calling it "desperate" and "privileged" attempts at making the song debut at number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, after predictions of Roddy Ricch's "The Box" rising to the top spot.
During an Instagram live session, Bieber asked his fans to stream and buy "Yummy" on iTunes, and reposted instructions from a fan titled "How to Get 'Yummy' to #1", detailing how to help the song hit number one on the chart.
Those instructions included buying the song multiple times on Bieber's website and iTunes, creating a Spotify playlist consisting only of "Yummy" and streaming it on repeat at low volume, and having fans outside the US download a VPN app, and set it to the US to inflate Bieber's US streams that contribute to the chart.
However, "Yummy" debuted only at number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, blocked from the number-one spot as "The Box" rose to the top spot.

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript adaptation (SICP JS) is an adaptation of the computer science textbook "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP).
It teaches fundamental principles of computer programming, including recursion, abstraction, modularity, and programming language design and implementation.
While the original version of SICP uses the programming language Scheme, this adaptation uses the programming language JavaScript.
The National University of Singapore published draft editions online since 2012, and a first public release on December 13 2019.
As of 2019, the book is continuously updated and improved by the community of its readers.
It has been used in NUS's introductory course in computer science.
As its original, SICP JS focuses on discovering general patterns for solving specific problems, and building software systems that make use of those patterns.
The book describes computer science concepts using Source, a series of sublanguages of JavaScript.
It also uses a virtual register machine and assembler to implement JavaScript interpreters and compilers.
The book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 License.
SICP JS has been used in the course CS1101S at the National University of Singapore (NUS) since 2012.
While the book focuses on principles, models and abstractions for programming rather than specific programming languages, all examples in the original version are written in the programming language Scheme.
SICP JS uses the language JavaScript instead of Scheme.
Since JavaScript shares its functional core with Scheme, the adaptation is straightforward and literal in most places.
Scheme's homoiconicity is replaced by references to an explicit parser in Chapters 4 and 5.
Source is a series of sublanguages of JavaScript, originally inspired by , Douglas Crockford.
It comprises the languages Source §1, Source §2, Source §3 and Source §4, corresponding to the respective chapters of SICP JS.
Each language is a sublanguage of the next, and designed to contain only features needed by the respective chapter.
These languages are implemented by the Source Academy, a web-based programming environment that features various tools to support the reader of SICP JS.
